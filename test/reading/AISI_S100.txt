                                              PREFACE 
             
               The North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members, as its 
            name implies, is intended for use throughout Canada, Mexico, and the United States. This 
            Specification supersedes the 2012 and previous editions of the North American Cold-Formed Steel 
            Specification, the previous editions of the Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural 
            Members published by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), and the previous editions of 
            CSA Group S136, Cold Formed Steel Structural Members, published by CSA Group. 
               The Specification was developed by a joint effort of the American Iron and Steel Institute  
            Committee on Specifications, CSA Group Technical Committee on Cold Formed Steel Structural 
            Members (S136), and Camara Nacional de la Industria del Hierro y del Acero (CANACERO) in 
            Mexico. This effort was coordinated through the North American Specification Committee, 
            which was made up of members from the AISI Committee on Specifications and the CSA Group 
            S136 Committee.  
               Since the Specification is intended for use in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, it was 
            necessary to develop a format that would allow for requirements particular to each country. 
            This resulted in a main document, Chapters A through M and Appendices 1 and 2, that is 
            intended for use in all three countries, and two country-specific appendices (A and B). 
            Appendix A is for use in both the United States and Mexico, and Appendix B is for use in 
            Canada. A symbol ( A,B   ) is used in the main document to point out that additional provisions 
            are provided in the corresponding appendices indicated by the letters.  
               This Specification provides an integrated treatment of Allowable Strength Design (ASD), Load 
            and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), and Limit States Design (LSD). This is accomplished by 
            including the appropriate resistance factors (f) for use with LRFD and LSD and the appropriate 
            safety factors (Ω) for use with ASD. It should be noted that the use of LSD is limited to Canada 
            and the use of ASD and LRFD is limited to the United States and Mexico. 
               The Specification also contains some terminology that is defined differently in Canada, the 
            United States, and Mexico. These differences are set out in Section A1.3, “Definitions.” In the 
            Specification, the terms that are specifically applicable to LSD are included in square brackets. 
            The Specification provides well-defined procedures for the design of load-carrying cold-formed 
            steel members in buildings, as well as other applications, provided that proper allowances are 
            made for dynamic effects. The provisions reflect the results of continuing research to develop 
            new and improved information on the structural behavior of cold-formed steel members. The 
            success of these efforts is evident in the wide acceptance of the previous editions of the 
            Specification.  
               The AISI and CSA Group consensus committees responsible for developing these provisions 
            provide a balanced forum, with representatives of steel producers, fabricators, users, educators, 
            researchers, and building code regulators. They are composed of engineers with a wide range of 
            experience and high professional standing from throughout Canada and the United States. 
            AISI, CSA Group, and CANACERO acknowledge the continuing dedication of the members of 
            the specifications committees and their subcommittees. The membership of these committees 
            follows this Preface.  
               The 2016 Edition of the Specification has been reorganized by incorporating the Direct 
            Strength Method design provisions into Chapters A through M. Also, the chapters are laid out to 
            be more in line with ANSI/AISC 360-2010. A section reference table of the 2012 Edition of the

            Specification and this edition is provided. 
               In addition to content reorganization, the following changes and additions are made in this 
            edition: 
              Section A2, Referenced Specifications, Codes and Standards. All the references, including 
                 those specific to U.S. and Mexico or Canada, are listed in the main body of the 
                 Specification. All the referenced standards are updated. 
              Section A3.2, Other Steels. The country-specific provisions are consolidated by bringing the 
                 provisions into the main body of the Specification. 
              Section B2, Loads and Load Combinations. The applicable building codes for determining the 
                 loads and load combinations are introduced for the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. 
              Section B3, Design Basis. This section introduces three design methods: ASD and LRFD are 
                 applicable to the U.S. and Mexico, and LSD is applicable to Canada. It references 
                 Specification chapters or sections that provide design provisions for required strength [effect 
                 due to factored loads] and available strengths [factored resistances], structural members, 
                 connections, stability, structural assemblies and systems, serviceability, ponding, fatigue, 
                 and corrosion effects.  
              Section B4, Dimensional Limits and Considerations. The limitations for applying the Effective 
                 Width Method and the Direct Strength Method are streamlined. 
              Section C1, Design for System Stability. The provisions consider Appendix 2, Second-Order 
                 Analysis, included in the 2012 Edition of the Specification, and incorporate system stability 
                 analysis approaches provided in ANSI/AISC 360.  
              Chapters E, F and G. The provisions of the Direct Strength Method included in Appendix 1 of 
                 the 2012 Edition of the Specification are incorporated into these chapters. 
              Section F2.1.1, Singly- or Doubly-Symmetric Sections Bending About Symmetric Axis. 
                 Simplified Equation F2.1.1-6 to determine elastic buckling stress, F cre , is no longer 
                 applicable to singly-symmetric C-Sections.  
              Section H1, Combined Axial Load and Bending. The interaction check equations for ASD, 
                 LRFD, and LSD are combined into one format, as applicable. 
              Section H1.2, Combined Compressive Axial Load and Bending. The interaction check 
                 equations are revised with the moment magnification effect taken into consideration 
                 through the system stability effect in accordance with Section C1. 
              Section I2, Floor, Roof, or Wall Steel Diaphragm Construction. AISI S310, AISI S240, and AISI 
                 S400 are introduced for diaphragm design, and the table of Safety and Resistance Factors 
                 for Diaphragms is moved to AISI S310. 
              Section I4, Cold-Formed Steel Light-Frame Construction. The cold-formed steel framing 
                 standards are updated.  
              Section I5, Special Bolted Moment Frame Systems. Special bolted moment frame systems 
                 should be designed in accordance with AISI S400. 
              Section I6.1, Members Strength: General Cross-Sections and System Connectivity. This 
                 section permits the bending and compression strengths of purlins and girts to be 
                 determined analytically provided the lateral, rotational, and composite stiffness provided 
                 by the deck or sheathing, bridging and bracing, and span continuity are included.   
              Section I7, Rack Systems. Rack system design should be in accordance with ANSI MH16.1. 
              Section J2, Welded Connections. The country-specific standards are brought into the main

                 body of the Specification.  
              Section J3, Bolted Connections. The table of Nominal Tensile and Shear Strengths for Bolts in 
                 Appendix A has been updated to be consistent with those in ANSI/AISC 360, and values 
                 for bolt diameters less than 0.5 in. (12 mm) have been revised. 
              Section J7.2, Power-Actuated Fasteners (PAFs) in Concrete. The PAF pull-out strength in 
                 shear in cold-formed steel framing track-to-concrete connections is added.  
              Section K1, Test Standards. The AISI S900 series of test standards are introduced, and the 
                 standards are also referenced in Section A2. 
              Section K2, Test for Special Cases. The sentence that the provisions shall not apply to cold-
                 formed steel diaphragms was deleted. 
              Section K2.1.1, Load and Resistance Factor Design and Limit States Design. The table of 
                 Statistical Data for the Determination of Resistance Factor is simplified. The sentence that 
                 Section K2.1.1(b) is not applicable to floor, roof or wall steel diaphragm was deleted. 
              Appendix 1, Effective Width of Elements. This appendix provides provisions for determining 
                 the effective width of elements as needed for the Effective Width Method. 
              Appendix 2, Elastic Buckling Analysis of Members. This new appendix provides analytical 
                 and numerical approaches to determine the local, distortional, and global buckling 
                 strengths.

                          NORTH AMERICAN SPECIFICATION FOR THE DESIGN OF  
                              COLD-FORMED STEEL STRUCTURAL MEMBERS  
                                                    
            A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 

               This chapter addresses the scope and applicability of the Specification, lists the definitions of 
            the terminology used, summarizes referenced specifications, codes, and standards, and 
            provides requirements for materials.  
               This chapter is organized as follows: 
              A1 Scope, Applicability, and Definitions 
              A2 Referenced Specifications, Codes, and Standards 
              A3 Material 
             
            A1 Scope, Applicability, and Definitions 

              A1.1 Scope  

                 This Specification applies to the design of structural members cold-formed to shape from 
              carbon or low-alloy steel sheet, strip, plate, or bar not more than 1 in. (25.4 mm) in thickness 
              and used for load-carrying purposes in  
              (a) Buildings, and 
              (b) Structures other than buildings provided allowances are made for dynamic effects. 
               
              A1.2 Applicability 

                 This Specification includes Symbols, Chapters A through M, Appendices A and B, and 
              Appendices 1 and 2 that shall apply as follows: 
                •  Chapters A through M, Appendices 1 and 2—the United States, Mexico, and Canada, 
                •  Appendix A—the United States and Mexico, and 
                •  Appendix B—Canada. 
                 The symbol  x  is used to point out that additional provisions that are specific to a 
              certain country are provided in the corresponding appendices indicated by the letter(s) “x.” 
                 This Specification includes design provisions for Allowable Strength Design (ASD), Load and 
              Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), and Limit States Design (LSD). These design methods shall 
              apply as follows:  
               •  ASD and LRFD—the United States and Mexico, and 
               •  LSD—Canada. 
                 In this Specification, bracketed terms are equivalent terms that apply particularly to LSD. 
                 The nominal strength [resistance]  and stiffness of cold-formed steel components such as 
              elements, members, assemblies, connections, and details shall be determined in accordance 
              with the provisions in Chapters B through M, Appendices A and B, and Appendices 1 and 2 
              of the Specification.  
                 Where the composition or configuration of the components is such that calculation of

              one of the following: 
              (a)  Available strength [factored resistance] or stiffness by tests only. Specifically, the available 
                 strength [factored resistance] is determined from tested nominal strength [resistance] by 
                 applying the safety factors or the resistance factors evaluated in accordance with Section 
                 K2.1.1(a);  
              (b) Available strength [factored resistance] by rational engineering analysis with confirmatory tests. 
                 Specifically, the available strength [factored resistance] is determined from the calculated 
                 nominal strength [resistance] by applying the safety factors or resistance factors evaluated in 
                 accordance with Section K2.1.1(b);  
              (c) Available strength [factored resistance] or stiffness by rational engineering analysis based on 
                 appropriate theory and engineering judgment. Specifically, the available strength [factored 
                 resistance] is determined from the calculated nominal strength [resistance] by applying the 
                 following safety factors or resistance factors: 
                  For members 
                   Ω = 2.00 (ASD) 
                   f  = 0.80 (LRFD) 
                     = 0.75 (LSD) 
                  For connections 
                   Ω = 3.00 (ASD) 
                   f  = 0.55 (LRFD) 
                     = 0.50 (LSD) 
                 When rational engineering analysis is used in accordance with Section A1.2(b) or A1.2(c) to 
              determine the nominal strength [resistance] for a limit state already provided in this Specification, 
              the safety factor shall not be less than the applicable safety factor (Ω), nor shall the resistance 
              factor exceed the applicable resistance factor (f) for the prescribed limit state.

                 This Specification requires the use of steels intended for structural applications as defined 
              in general by the specifications of ASTM International listed in this section. The term SS 
              designates structural steels and the terms HSLAS and HSLAS-F designate high-strength low-
              alloy steels. Steels that do not meet the requirements specified in Sections A3.1 are permitted 
              to be used for structural applications provided Section A3.2 is met. 
                  
              A3.1 Applicable Steels 

                 This section shall apply to steels that are based on specifications providing mandatory 
              mechanical properties and requiring test reports to confirm those properties.  
                 Steels used in structural members, decks, and connections shall follow uses and restrictions 
              outlined in this section and sub-sections, as applicable.

              forces and deformations used in design shall be consistent with the intended performance of 
              the connection and the assumptions used in structural analysis. Self-limiting inelastic 
              deformations of the connections are permitted. At the points of support, beams and trusses 
              shall be restrained against rotation about their longitudinal axis unless other means of 
              restraints against rotation are provided.

                   Cold-formed steel to concrete anchorage shall be designed according to the applicable 
                building code. For cast-in-place or post-installed anchors, connection strength controlled by 
                cold-formed steel members or connector components shall be designed in accordance with 
                the provisions of Section J3. 
                  
              B3.5 Design for Stability 

                 Stability of a structural system and its members shall be determined in accordance with 
              Chapter C. 
                  
              B3.6 Design of Structural Assemblies and Systems

              B3.8 Design for Ponding 

                 The roof system shall be investigated through rational engineering analysis to ensure 
              strength and stability under ponding conditions, unless the roof surface is configured to 
              prevent the accumulation of water.  
             
              B3.9 Design for Fatigue 

                 Fatigue shall be considered in accordance with Chapter M for cold-formed steel structural 
              members and their connections subject to repeated loading within the elastic range of stresses of 
              frequency and magnitude sufficient to initiate cracking and progressive failure. Fatigue need 
              not be considered for seismic effects or for the effects of wind loading on typical building 
              lateral force-resisting systems and building enclosure components. 
                  
              B3.10  Design for Corrosion Effects 

                 Where corrosion may impair the strength or serviceability of a structure, structural 
              components shall be protected against corrosion or shall be designed to tolerate corrosion. 
             
            B4 Dimensional Limits and Considerations  

               Either the Effective Width Method or the Direct Strength Method shall be equally acceptable. 
            When the Effective Width Method or the Direct Strength Method presented in Chapters E through 
            H is used, the limitations detailed in Section B4.1 shall be met in order to use the safety and 
            resistance factors provided in Chapters E through H. Members that do not meet the limits of B4.1 
            shall follow Section B4.2 for determination of the safety factor, Ω, or resistance factor, f. 
             
              B4.1 Limitations for Use of the Effective Width Method or the Direct Strength Method 

                 Members designed in accordance with the Effective Width Method or the Direct Strength 
              Method and employing the safety factor, Ω, or resistance factor, f, of Chapters E though H shall 
              fall within the dimensional limitations of Table B4.1-1.

              shall be subjected to the provisions of Section A1.2, with the exception that members are 
              permitted to be designed using the Direct Strength Method provided the safety factor, Ω, and

            C. DESIGN FOR STABILITY 
               This chapter addresses requirements for the design of structures for stability. 
               The chapter is organized as follows:

                C2 Member Bracing 
                
            C1 Design for System Stability 

               This chapter addresses requirements for the elastic design of structures for stability.  System 
            stability shall be provided for the structure as a whole and for each of its elements. The effects of 
            all of the following on the stability of the structure and its elements shall be considered: 
            (a) Flexural, shear, and axial member deformations, and all other component and connection 
               deformations that contribute to displacements of the structure;  
            (b) Second-order effects (including P-Δ and P-δ effects);  
            (c) Geometric imperfections;  
            (d) Stiffness reductions due to inelasticity, including the effect of residual stresses and partial 
               yielding of the cross-section;  
            (e) Stiffness reductions due to cross-section deformations or local and distortional buckling; 
            (f) Uncertainty in system, member, and connection stiffness and strength. 
               All load-dependent effects shall be calculated at a level of loading corresponding to LRFD 
            load combinations, LSD load combinations, or 1.6 times ASD load combinations. 
               Any rational method of design for stability that considers all of the listed effects is permitted, 
            including the methods identified in Section C1.1, C1.2, or C1.3 within the limitations stated 
            therein. 
                 
              C1.1 Direct Analysis Method Using Rigorous Second-Order Elastic Analysis 

                 The direct analysis method of design, which consists of the calculation of required strengths 
              [effects due to factored loads] in accordance with Section C1.1.1 and the calculation of available 
              strengths [factored resistance] in accordance with Section C1.1.2, is permitted for all systems. 
                    
                C1.1.1 Determination of Required Strengths 

                   For the direct analysis method of design, the required strengths [effects due to factored 
                loads] of components of the structure shall be determined from an analysis conforming to 
                Section C1.1.1.1. The analysis shall include consideration of initial imperfections in 
                accordance with Section C1.1.1.2 and adjustments to stiffness in accordance with Section 
                C1.1.1.3. 
                      
                  C1.1.1.1  Analysis 

                     It is permitted to use any elastic analysis method capable of explicit consideration of 
                  the P-∆ and P-δ effects by capturing the effects of system and member displacements, 
                  respectively, on member forces. 
                     Alternatively, it is permitted to use any elastic analysis method capable of explicit

                  consideration of the P-∆ effects by capturing the effects of system displacements on 
                  member forces. The required flexural strength [effect due to factored loads],  M, shall then 
                  be taken as the moment resulting from such an analysis amplified by B 1 , where B 1  is 
                  determined in accordance with Section C1.2.1.1. 
             
                  C1.1.1.2  Consideration of Initial Imperfections 

                     Initial imperfections at the points of member intersection shall be considered as 
                  provided by either (a) or (b) below. Additionally, it is permitted, but not required, to 
                  consider imperfections in the initial position of points along members.  
                  (a) Direct Geometric Consideration of Initial Imperfections:  
                     In all cases, it is permitted to account for the effect of initial imperfections by 
                  including the imperfections directly in the analysis. The structure shall be analyzed with 
                  points of intersection of members displaced from their nominal locations. The 
                  magnitude of the initial displacements shall be the maximum amount considered in the 
                  design; the pattern of initial displacements shall be such that it provides the greatest 
                  destabilizing effect.  
                     In the analysis of structures that support gravity loads primarily through nominally 
                  vertical columns, walls, or frames, where the ratio of maximum second-order elastic 
                  analysis story drift to maximum first-order elastic analysis story drift (both determined for 
                  LRFD or LSD load combinations or 1.6 times ASD load combinations, with stiffnesses as 
                  specified in Section C1.1.1.3) in all stories is equal to or less than 1.7, it is permissible to 
                  include initial imperfections only in the analysis for gravity-only load combinations and 
                  not in the analysis for load combinations that include applied lateral loads. 
                  (b) Consideration of Initial Imperfections Through Application of Notional Loads:  
                     For structures that support gravity loads primarily through nominally vertical 
                  columns, walls, or frames, it is permitted to use notional loads to represent the effects of 
                  initial imperfections in accordance with the requirements of this section. The notional 
                  load shall be applied to a model of the structure based on its nominal geometry. 
                  (1) Notional loads shall be applied as lateral loads at all levels. The notional loads shall be 
                     additive to other lateral loads and shall be applied in all load combinations, except as 
                     indicated in (3), below. The magnitude of the notional loads shall be: 
                    Ni   = (1/240)αYi                                             ( Eq. C1.1.1.2-1 ) 
                      where 
                      α  = 1.0 (LRFD or LSD) 
                         = 1.6 (ASD) 
                      Ni   = Notional load applied at level i 
                      Yi   = Gravity load applied at level i from LRFD, LSD, or ASD load combinations, as 
                          applicable 
             
                     Where the applicable project or other quality assurance criteria stipulate a more 
                     stringent imperfection criteria, (1/240) in the above equation is permitted to be 
                     replaced by a lesser value. 
                  (2) The notional load at any level, Ni , shall be distributed over that level in the same 
                     manner as the gravity load at the level. The notional loads shall be applied in the 
                     direction that provides the greatest destabilizing effect.

                  (3) For structures in which the ratio of maximum second-order elastic analysis story drift 
                     to maximum first-order elastic analysis story drift (both determined for LRFD load 
                     combinations or LSD load combinations, or 1.6 times ASD load combinations, with 
                     stiffnesses adjusted as specified in Section C1.1.1.3) in all stories is equal to or less 
                     than 1.7, it is permitted to apply the notional load, N i , only in gravity-only load 
                     combinations and not in combinations that include other lateral loads. 
             
                  C1.1.1.3  Modification of Section Stiffness 

                     The analysis of the structure to determine the required strengths [effects due to factored 
                  loads] of components shall use reduced stiffnesses, as follows: 
                  (a) A factor of 0.90 shall be applied to all stiffnesses considered to contribute to the 
                     stability of the structure. Additionally, it is permitted, but not required, to also apply 
                     the stiffness reduction to those members that are not part of the lateral force resisting 
                     system. 
                  (b) An additional factor, τ b , shall be applied to the flexural stiffnesses of all members 
                     whose flexural stiffnesses are considered to contribute to the stability of the structure. 
                   For α P/P y  ≤ 0.5,  
                      τb  = 1.0                                                   (Eq. C1.1.1.3-1) 
                   For α P/P y  > 0.5,  
                      τb  = 4(α P/P y )[1− (α P/P y )]                                 (Eq. C1.1.1.3-2) 
                        where 
                        α  = 1.0 (LRFD or LSD) 
                            = 1.6 (ASD) 
                        P  = Required axial compressive strength [compressive force due to factored loads] 
                            using LRFD, LSD, or ASD load combinations 
                        Py   = Axial yield strength   
                            = F y Ag                                              (Eq. C1.1.1.3-3) 
                          where 
                          Fy  = Yield stress 
                          Ag  = Gross area of cross-section 
                  (c) In lieu of using τ b  < 1.0 where α P/P y  > 0.5, it is permitted to use τ b  = 1.0 for all 
                     members if a notional load of (1/1000)αYi  is applied at all levels, in the direction 
                     specified in Section C1.1.1.2, in all load combinations. These notional loads shall be 
                     added to those stipulated in Section C1.1.1.2, except that C1.1.1.2(3) shall not apply. 
                  (d) Where components comprised of materials other than cold-formed steel are 
                     considered to contribute to the stability of the structure, stiffness reductions shall be 
                     applied to those components as required by the codes and specifications governing 
                     their design. 
             
                C1.1.2 Determination of Available Strengths [Factored Resistances] 

                   The available strengths [factored resistances] of members and connections shall be 
                calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapters D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, as 
                applicable, with no further consideration of overall structure stability. The flexural buckling

                effective length factors, K y  and K x , of all members shall be taken as unity unless a smaller 
                value can be justified by rational engineering analysis. 
                   Bracing intended to define the unbraced lengths of members shall have enough stiffness 
                and strength to control member movement at the braced points, and shall be designed in 
                accordance with Section C2. 
                   When initial imperfections in the position of points along a member are considered in 
                the analysis in addition to imperfections at the points of intersection as stipulated in 
                Section C1.1.1.2, it is permissible to take the flexural buckling strength of the member in the 
                plane of the initial imperfection as the cross-section strength. The available strengths [factored 
                resistances] due to torsional, flexural-torsional, local, and distortional buckling of compression 
                members shall be as specified in Chapter E.

                 The direct analysis method of design, which consists of the calculation of required strengths 
              [effects due to factored loads] in accordance with Section C1.2.1 and the calculation of available 
              strengths [factored resistance] in accordance with Section C1.2.2, shall be limited to structures 
              that support gravity loads primarily through nominally vertical columns, walls, or frames. 
             
                C1.2.1 Determination of Required Strengths [Effects due to Factored Loads] 

                   For the direct analysis method of design, the required strengths [effects due to factored 
                loads] of components of the structure shall be determined from an analysis conforming to 
                Section C1.2.1.1. The analysis shall include consideration of initial imperfections in 
                accordance with Section C1.2.1.2 and adjustments to stiffness in accordance with Section 
                C1.2.1.3.

                  strength [axial force due to factored loads],  P, of all members shall be determined as 
                  follows:

                   For the design, the required strengths [effects due to factored loads] of components of the 
                structure shall be determined from an analysis conforming to Section C1.3.1.1. The analysis 
                shall include consideration of initial imperfections in accordance with Section C1.3.1.2. 
             
                  C1.3.1.1  Analysis 

                     The analysis shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of Section 
                  C1.2.1.1, except that nominal stiffnesses shall be used in the analysis and Section C1.2.1.3 
                  shall not apply.

                   The available strengths [factored resistances] of members and connections shall be 
                calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapters D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, as 
                applicable. 
                   The flexural buckling effective length factors, K x  and K y , of members subject to 
                compression shall be taken as specified in (a) or (b), below, as applicable: 
                (a) In braced frame systems, shear wall systems, and other structural systems where lateral 
                   stability and resistance to lateral loads do not rely on the flexural stiffness of columns, K x  
                   and K y  of members subject to compression shall be taken as 1.0, unless rational 
                   engineering analysis indicates that a lower value is appropriate. 
                (b) In moment frame systems and other structural systems in which the flexural stiffnesses of 
                   columns are considered to contribute to lateral stability and resistance to lateral loads, 
                   Kx  and K y , or elastic critical buckling stress, F cre , of those columns whose flexural 
                   stiffnesses are considered to contribute to lateral stability and resistance to lateral loads 
                   shall be determined from a sidesway buckling analysis of the structure; Kx  and K y  shall 
                   be taken as 1.0 for columns whose flexural stiffnesses are not considered to contribute to 
                   lateral stability and resistance to lateral loads. 
                   Exception: It is permitted to take Kx  or K y , as applicable, as 1.0 in the design of all 
                   columns if the ratio of maximum second-order drift to maximum first-order drift (both 
                   determined for LRFD or LSD load combinations or 1.6 times ASD load combinations) in all 
                   stories is equal to or less than 1.1. 
             
                   Bracing intended to define the unbraced lengths of members shall have enough stiffness 
                and strength to control member movement at the braced points, and shall be designed in 
                accordance with Section C2.

            G. MEMBERS IN SHEAR AND WEB CRIPPLING 
               This chapter addresses webs of singly-, doubly-, or point symmetric cross-section members 
            subject to shear in the plane of web, or web crippling due to high intensity of load or reaction on 
            the web. The webs may contain holes or transverse web reinforcement. The design of transverse 
            web stiffeners is considered as well. 
             
               This chapter is organized as follows: 
              G1 General Requirements 
              G2 Shear Strength of Webs Without Holes

              G5 Web Crippling Strength of Webs Without Holes 
              G6 Web Crippling Strength of C-Section Webs With Holes 
                
            G1 General Requirements 

               The available shear strength [factored resistance] shall be determined in accordance with Section 
            G2 for webs without holes and Section G3 for webs with holes, as applicable. Transverse web 
            stiffeners shall be designed in accordance with Section G4, as applicable. Webs subjected to 
            concentrated loads shall be checked for web crippling in accordance with Sections G5 or G6, as 
            applicable. 
             
            G2 Shear Strength of Webs Without Holes  

               The nominal shear strength [resistance], V n , of flexural members without holes in the web(s) 
            shall be calculated in accordance with this section, as applicable. For flexural members meeting 
            the geometric and material criteria of Section B4, Ωv  and f v  shall be as follows:  
              Ωv  = 1.60 (ASD)

               Pn  and P nc  shall represent the nominal strengths [resistances] for load or reaction for one solid 
            web connecting top and bottom flanges. For hat, multi-web sections and C- or Z-sections, P n  or 
            Pnc  shall be the nominal strength [resistance] for a single web, and the total nominal strength 
            [resistance] shall be computed by multiplying P n  or P nc  by the number of webs at the considered 
            cross-section.  
               One-flange loading or reaction shall be defined as the condition where the clear distance 
            between the bearing edges of adjacent opposite concentrated loads or reactions is equal to or 
            greater than 1.5h. 
               Two-flange loading or reaction shall be defined as the condition where the clear distance 
            between the bearing edges of adjacent opposite concentrated loads or reactions is less than 1.5h. 
               End loading or reaction shall be defined as the condition where the distance from the edge 
            of the bearing to the end of the member is equal to or less than 1.5h. 
               Interior loading or reaction shall be defined as the condition where the distance from the 
            edge of the bearing to the end of the member is greater than 1.5h, except as otherwise noted 
            herein.

            I.  ASSEMBLIES AND SYSTEMS 
               This chapter addresses design provisions related to cold-formed steel assemblies and 
            systems.  
               The chapter is organized as follows: 
              I1  Built-Up Sections 
              I2  Floor, Roof, or Wall Steel Diaphragm Construction 
              I3  Mixed Systems 
              I4  Cold-Formed Steel Light-Frame Construction 
              I5  Special Bolted Moment Frame Systems 
              I6  Metal Roof and Wall Systems 
              I7  Rack Systems 
             
            I1 Built-Up Sections 
              I1.1  Flexural Members Composed of Two Back-to-Back C-Sections 
                 The maximum longitudinal spacing of connections (one or more welds or other 
              connectors), s max , joining two C-sections to form an I-section shall be: 
                             2gT smax  = L / 6 or    s ,  whichever is smaller                                 (Eq. I1.1-1) mq
                  where 
                  L = Span of beam 
                  g = Vertical distance between two rows of connections nearest to top and bottom flanges 
                  Ts  = Available strength [factored resistance] of connection in tension (Chapter J) 
                  m = Distance from shear center of one C-section to mid-plane of web 
                  q = Design load [factored load] on beam for determining longitudinal spacing of 
                      connections (See below for methods of determination.) 
                    The load, q, shall be obtained by dividing the concentrated loads or reactions by the 
                  length of bearing. For beams designed for a uniformly distributed load, q shall be taken 
                  as equal to three times the uniformly distributed load, based on the critical load 
                  combinations for ASD, LRFD, and LSD. If the length of bearing of a concentrated load or 
                  reaction is smaller than the longitudinal connection spacing, s, the required strength [force 
                  due to factored loads] of the connections closest to the load or reaction shall be calculated as 
                  follows: 
             
                  Tr  = P s m/2g                                                      (Eq. I1.1-2) 
                    where  
                    Ps    = Concentrated load [factored load] or reaction based on critical load combinations 
                          for ASD, LRFD, and LSD 
                    Tr    = Required strength [force due to factored loads] of connection in tension 
                 The allowable maximum spacing of connections, s max , shall depend upon the intensity of 
              the load directly at the connection. Therefore, if uniform spacing of connections is used over the 
              whole length of the beam, it shall be determined at the point of maximum local load intensity. 
              In cases where this procedure would result in uneconomically close spacing, either one of the 
              following methods is permitted to be adopted:

            (a) The connection spacing varies along the beam according to the variation of the load 
               intensity, or  
            (b) Reinforcing cover plates are welded to the flanges at points where concentrated loads 
               occur. The available shear strength [factored resistance] of the connections joining these plates 
               to the flanges is then used for T s , and g is taken as the depth of the beam. 
                 
            I1.2  Compression Members Composed of Two Sections in Contact 
               For compression members composed of two sections in contact, the available axial strength 
            [factored resistance] shall be determined in accordance with Section E2 subject to the following 
            modification. If the buckling mode involves relative deformations that produce shear forces in 
            the connectors between individual shapes, KL/r is replaced by (KL/r) m  calculated as follows:  
                                2 KL    KL2 a   =    +                                          (Eq. I1.2-1)  r m   r   o  ri 
                where 
                (KL/r) o  = Overall slenderness ratio of entire section about built-up member axis  
                a       = Intermediate fastener or spot weld spacing 
                ri       = Minimum radius of gyration of full unreduced cross-sectional area of an 
                        individual shape in a built-up member 
                See Section E2.1 for definition of other symbols. 
                In addition, the fastener strength and spacing shall satisfy the following: 
                 (a) The intermediate fastener or spot weld spacing, a, is limited such that a/r i  does not 
                   exceed one-half the governing slenderness ratio of the built-up member. 
                 (b) The ends of a built-up compression member are connected by a weld having a 
                   length not less than the maximum width of the member or by connectors spaced 
                   longitudinally not more than 4 diameters apart for a distance equal to 1.5 times the 
                   maximum width of the member. 
                 (c) The intermediate fastener(s) or weld(s) at any longitudinal member tie location are 
                   capable of transmitting the required strength [force due to factored loads] in any 
                   direction of 2.5 percent of the available axial strength [factored resistance] of the built-
                   up member. 
        
            I1.3  Spacing of Connections in Cover-Plated Sections 
               To develop the strength required of the compression element, the spacing, s, in the line of 
            stress, of welds, rivets, or bolts connecting a cover plate, sheet, or a non-integral stiffener in 
            compression to another element shall not exceed (a), (b), and (c) as follows: 
            (a) That which is required to transmit the shear between the connected parts on the basis of 
               the available strength [factored resistance] per connection specified elsewhere herein, 
            (b) 1.5t    f/E αc  
                where  
                t    = Thickness of the cover plate or sheet 
                E   = Modulus of elasticity of steel 
                fc     = Compressive stress in the cover plate or sheet based on ASD, LRFD, or LSD load 
                     combinations

                  α   = Coefficient 
                      = 1.67 for ASD load combinations, and 
                      = 1.0   for LRFD or LSD load combinations 
              (c) Three times the flat width, w, of the narrowest unstiffened compression element tributary 
                 to the connections, but need not be less than 1.11t   F/E  y  if w/t < 0.50   F/E  y , or 1.33t

                     F/E  y  if w/t ≥ 0.50   F/E  y , unless closer spacing is required by (a) or (b) above. 

                 In the case of intermittent fillet welds parallel to the direction of stress, the spacing shall 
              be taken as the clear distance between welds, plus 1/2 in. (12.7 mm). In all other cases, the 
              spacing shall be taken as the center-to-center distance between connections. 
              Exception: The requirements of this section do not apply to cover sheets that act only as 
              sheathing material and are not considered load-carrying elements. 
                 When any of the limits in (a), (b), or (c) in this section are exceeded, the effective width shall 
              be determined in accordance with Section 1.1.4.

            I6.4  Roof System Bracing and Anchorage 
              I6.4.1 Anchorage of Bracing for Purlin Roof Systems Under Gravity Load With Top Flange 
                   Connected to Metal Sheathing 
                 Anchorage, in the form of a device capable of transferring force from the roof diaphragm 
              to a support, shall be provided for roof systems with C-sections or Z-sections, designed in 
              accordance with Chapter F, Section I6.1 or I6.2, having through-fastened or standing seam 
              sheathing attached to the top flanges. Each anchorage device shall be designed to resist the 
              force, P L , determined by Eq. I6.4.1-1 and shall satisfy the minimum stiffness requirement of 
              Eq. I6.4.1-7. In addition, purlins shall be restrained laterally by the sheathing so that the 
              maximum top flange lateral displacements between lines of lateral anchorage resulting 
              from ASD load combinations (specified loads for LSD) do not exceed the span length divided 
              by 360. 
                 Anchorage devices shall be located in each purlin bay and shall connect to the purlin at 
              or near the purlin top flange. If anchorage devices are not directly connected to all purlin 
              lines of each purlin bay, provision shall be made to transmit the forces from other purlin 
              lines to the anchorage devices. It shall be demonstrated that the required force, P L , can be 
              transferred to the anchorage device through the roof sheathing and its fastening system. 
              The lateral stiffness of the anchorage device shall be determined by analysis or testing. This 
              analysis or testing shall account for the flexibility of the purlin web above the attachment of 
              the anchorage device connection.

                 For multi-span systems, force P i , calculated in accordance with Eq. I6.4.1-2 and 
              coefficients C1 to C4 from Tables I6.4.1-1 to I6.4.1-3 for the “Exterior Frame Line,” “End 
              Bay,” or “End Bay Exterior Anchor” cases, shall not be taken as less than 80 percent of the 
              force determined using the coefficients C2 to C4 for the corresponding “All Other 
              Locations” case. 
                 For systems with multiple spans and anchorage devices at supports (support 
              restraints), where the two adjacent bays have different section properties or span lengths, 
              the following procedures are to be used:  
              (a) The values for P i  in Eq. I6.4.1-1 and Eq. I6.4.1-8 shall be taken as the average of the 
                 values found from Eq. I6.4.1-2 evaluated separately for each of the two bays, and  
              (b) The values of K sys  used in Eq. I6.4.1-5 and K eff  in Eq. I6.4.1-1 and Eq. I6.4.1-5 shall be  i,j
                 calculated using Eq. I6.4.1-4 and Eq. I6.4.1-6, with L, t, and d taken as the average of the 
                 values of the two bays. 
                 For systems with multiple spans and anchorage devices at either 1/3 points or mid-
              points, where the adjacent bays have different section properties or span lengths than the 
              bay under consideration, the following procedures are to be used to account for the 
              influence of the adjacent bays:  
              (a) The values for P i  in Eq. I6.4.1-1 and Eq. I6.4.1-8 shall be taken as the average of the 
                 values found from Eq. I6.4.1-2 evaluated separately for each of the three bays,  
              (b) The value of K sys  in Eq. I6.4.1-5 shall be calculated using Eq. I6.4.1-6, with L, t, and d 
                 taken as the average of the values from the three bays,  
              (c) The values of K eff  shall be calculated using Eq. I6.4.1-4, with L taken as the span  i,j
                 length of the bay under consideration, and  
              (d) At an end bay, when computing the average values for P i  or averaging the properties 
                 for computing K sys , the averages shall be found by adding the value from the first 
                 interior bay and two times the value from the end bay and then dividing the sum by 
                 three. 
                 The total effective stiffness at each purlin shall satisfy the following equation: 
           
                       KK    ≥                                                 (Eq. I6.4.1-7)  i   req

                 In lieu of Eqs. I6.4.1-1 through I6.4.1-6, lateral restraint forces are permitted to be

                second-order effect and account for the effects of roof slope, torsion resulting from applied 
                loads eccentric to shear center, torsion resulting from the lateral resistance provided by the 
                sheathing, and load applied oblique to the principal axes. Alternative analysis shall also 
                include the effects of the lateral and rotational restraint provided by sheathing attached to 
                the top flange. Stiffness of the anchorage device shall be considered and shall account for 
                flexibility of the purlin web above the attachment of the anchorage device connection. 
                   When lateral restraint forces are determined from rational engineering analysis, the 
                maximum top flange lateral displacement of the purlin between lines of lateral bracing 
                resulting from ASD load combinations (specified loads for LSD) shall not exceed the span 
                length divided by 360. The lateral displacement of the purlin top flange at the line of 
                restraint, Δ tf , shall  satisfy Eq. I6.4.1-9a for ASD load combinations and Eq. I6.4.1-9b for LRFD

              I6.4.2 Alternate Lateral and Stability Bracing for Purlin Roof Systems 
                 Torsional bracing that prevents twist about the longitudinal axis of a member in 
              combination with lateral restraints that resist lateral displacement of the top flange at the 
              frame line is permitted in lieu of the requirements of Section I6.4.1. A torsional brace shall 
              prevent torsional rotation of the cross-section at a discrete location along the span of the 
              member. Connection of braces shall be made at or near both flanges of ordinary open 
              sections, including C- and Z-sections. The effectiveness of torsional braces in preventing 
              torsional rotation of the cross-section and the required strength [brace force due to factored 
              loads] of lateral restraints at the frame line shall be determined by rational engineering 
              analysis or testing. The lateral displacement of the top flange of the C- or Z-section at the 
              frame line shall be limited to d/(20Ω) for ASD load combinations or fd/20 for LRFD and 
              LSD load combinations, where d is the depth of the C- or Z-section member, Ω is the safety 
              factor for ASD, and f is the resistance factor for LRFD and LSD. Lateral displacement 
              between frame lines resulting from ASD load combinations (specified loads for LSD) shall be 
              limited to L/180, where L is the span length of the member. For pairs of adjacent purlins 
              that provide bracing against twist to each other, external anchorage of torsional brace 
              forces shall not be required. 
                where 
                Ω = 2.0  (ASD) 
                f  = 0.75 (LRFD)

              K2.1 Tests for Determining Structural Performance 

                K2.1.1 Load and Resistance Factor Design and Limit States Design 

                   Any structural performance that is required to be established by tests in accordance 
                with Section A1.2(a) or by rational engineering analysis with confirmatory tests in accordance 
                with Section A1.2(b) shall be evaluated with the following performance procedure: 
                (a) Evaluation of the test results for use with Section A1.2(a) shall be made on the basis of 
                   the average value of test data resulting from tests of not fewer than three identical 
                   specimens, provided the deviation of any individual test result from the average value

                   obtained from all tests does not exceed  ±15 percent. If such deviation from the average 
                   value exceeds 15 percent, more tests of the same kind shall be made until the deviation 
                   of any individual test result from the average value obtained from all tests does not 
                   exceed  ±15 percent or until at least three additional tests have been made. No test result 
                   shall be eliminated unless a rationale for its exclusion is given. The average value of all 
                   tests made shall then be regarded as the nominal strength [resistance], R n , for the series of 
                   the tests. R n  and the coefficient of variation V P  of the test results shall be determined by 
                   statistical analysis. 
                (b) Evaluation of a rational engineering analysis model by confirmatory tests for use with 
                   Section A1.2(b): The correlation coefficient, C c , between the tested strength [resistance] 
                   (R t ) and the nominal strength [resistance] (R n ) predicted from the rational engineering 
                   analysis model shall be greater than or equal to 0.80. Only one limit state is permitted 
                   for evaluation of the rational engineering analysis model being verified, and the test 
                   result shall reflect the limit state under consideration. 
                  The rational engineering analysis model is only verified within parameters varied in the 
                   testing. Extrapolation outside of the tested parameters is not permitted. For each 
                   parameter being evaluated:  
                    (1) All other parameters shall be held constant,  
                    (2) The nominally selected values of the parameter to be tested shall not bias the 
                       study to a specific region of the parameter, and  
                    (3) A minimum of three tests shall be performed. No test results shall be eliminated 
                       unless a rationale for their exclusion is given. 
                  Dimensions and material properties shall be measured for all test specimens. The as-
                   measured dimensions and properties shall be used in determination of the calculated 
                   nominal strength [resistance] (R n,i ) as employed in determining the resistance factor or 
                   safety factor in accordance with (c). The specified dimensions and properties shall be 
                   used in the determination of the calculated nominal strength [resistance] for design. The 
                   bias and variance between the as-measured dimensions and properties and the 
                   nominally specified dimensions and properties shall be reflected in the selected 
                   material (M m , V M ) and fabrication (F m , V F ) factors per Table K2.1.1-1. Otherwise, the 
                   selected values of M m  and F m  shall not be greater than in Table K2.1.1-1, and the values 
                   of V M  and V F  shall not be less than the values given in Table K2.1.1-1. 
                (c) The strength of the tested elements, assemblies, connections, or members shall satisfy 
                   Eq. K2.1.1-1a or Eq. K2.1.1-1b as applicable.

                  The listing in Table K2.1.1-1 shall not exclude the use of other documented statistical 
                   data if they are established from sufficient results on material properties and 
                   fabrication. 
                  For steels not listed in Section A3.1, the values of M m  and V M  shall be determined by 
                   the statistical analysis for the materials used. 
                  When distortions interfere with the proper functioning of the specimen in actual use, 
                   the load effects based on the critical load combination at the occurrence of the 
                   acceptable distortion shall also satisfy Eq. K2.1.1-1a or Eq. K2.1.1-1b, as applicable, 
                   except that the resistance factor, f, shall be taken as unity and the load factor for dead 
                   load shall be taken as 1.0. 
                (d) For strength determined in accordance with Section K2.1.1(a) or K2.1.1(b), the 
                   mechanical properties of the steel sheet shall be determined based on representative 
                   samples of the material taken from the test specimen or the flat sheet used to form the 
                   test specimen. Alternatively, for connectors or devices that are too small to obtain 
                   standard size or sub-size tensile specimens per ASTM A370, and are produced from 
                   steel sheet coils that have not undergone a secondary process to alter the mechanical or 
                   chemical properties, mechanical properties are permitted to be determined based on 
                   mill certificates, and the mean value of the material factor, M m , shall be equal to 0.85. If 
                   the yield stress of the steel is larger than the specified value, the test results shall be 
                   adjusted down to the specified minimum yield stress of the steel that the manufacturer 
                   intends to use. The test results shall not be adjusted upward if the yield stress of the test 
                   specimen is less than the specified minimum yield stress. Similar adjustments shall be 
                   made on the basis of tensile strength instead of yield stress where tensile strength is the 
                   critical factor. 
                   Consideration shall also be given to any variation or differences between the design

                K2.1.2 Allowable Strength Design 

                   Where the composition or configuration of elements, assemblies, connections, or details 
                of cold-formed steel structural members are such that calculation of their strength cannot be 
                made in accordance with the provisions of this Specification, their structural performance 
                shall be established from tests and evaluated in accordance with Section K2.1.1, except as 
                modified in this section for allowable strength design. 
                   The allowable strength shall be calculated as follows: 
                  Ra  = R n /Ω                                                      (Eq. K2.1.2-1)

                   The required strength shall be determined from ASD load combinations as described in

              K2.2 Tests for Confirming Structural Performance 

                 For structural members, connections, and assemblies for which the nominal strength 
              [resistance] is computed in accordance with this Specification or its specific references, 
              confirmatory tests are permitted to be made to demonstrate the strength is not less than the 
              nominal strength [resistance], R n , specified in this Specification or its specific references for the 
              type of behavior involved. 
             
              K2.3 Tests for Determining Mechanical Properties 

                K2.3.1 Full Section 

                   Tests for determination of mechanical properties of full sections to be used in Section 
                A3.3.2 shall be conducted in accordance with this section: 
                (a) Tensile testing procedures shall conform to the requirements of ASTM A370.  
                (b) Compressive yield stress determinations shall be made by means of compression tests of 
                   short specimens of the section. See AISI S902. 
                   The compressive yield stress shall be taken as the smaller value of either the maximum 
                   compressive strength of the sections divided by the cross-sectional area or the stress 
                   defined by one of the following methods: 
                    (1) For sharp-yielding steel, the yield stress is determined by the autographic diagram 
                       method or by the total strain under load method. 
                    (2) For gradual-yielding steel, the yield stress is determined by the strain under load 
                       method or by the 0.2 percent offset method. 
                  When the total strain under load method is used, there shall be evidence that the yield 
                   stress so determined is within five (5) percent with the yield stress that would be 
                   determined by the 0.2 percent offset method. 
                (c) Where the principal effect of the loading to which the member will be subjected in 
                   service will be to produce bending stresses, the yield stress shall be determined for the 
                   flanges only. In determining such yield stress, each specimen shall consist of one 
                   complete flange plus a portion of the web of such flat width ratio that the value of ρ for 
                   the specimen is unity. 
                (d) For acceptance and control purposes, one full section test shall be made from each 
                   master coil.  
                (e) At the option of the manufacturer, either tension or compression tests are permitted to 
                   be used for routine acceptance and control purposes, provided the manufacturer 
                   demonstrates that such tests reliably indicate the yield stress of the section when 
                   subjected to the kind of stress under which the member is to be used. 
             
                K2.3.2 Flat Elements of Formed Sections 

                   Tests for determining mechanical properties of flat elements of formed sections and 
                representative mechanical properties of virgin steel to be used in Section A3.3.2 shall be 
                made in accordance with this section. 
                   The yield stress of flats, Fyf , shall be established by means of a weighted average of the

                yield stresses of standard tensile coupons taken longitudinally from the flat portions of a 
                representative cold-formed member. The weighted average shall be the sum of the 
                products of the average yield stress for each flat portion times its cross-sectional area, divided 
                by the total area of flats in the cross-section. Although the exact number of such coupons 
                will depend on the shape of the member, i.e., on the number of flats in the cross-section, at 
                least one tensile coupon shall be taken from the middle of each flat. If the actual virgin yield 
                stress exceeds the specified minimum yield stress, the yield stress of the flats, F yf , shall be 
                adjusted by multiplying the test values by the ratio of the specified minimum yield stress to 
                the actual virgin yield stress. 
                  
                K2.3.3 Virgin Steel 

                   The following provisions shall apply to steel produced to other than the ASTM 
                Specifications listed in Section A3.1 when used in sections for which the increased yield 
                stress of the steel after cold forming is computed from the virgin steel properties in 
                accordance with Section A3.3.2. For acceptance and control purposes, at least four tensile 
                specimens shall be taken from each master coil for the establishment of the representative 
                values of the virgin tensile yield stress and tensile strength. Specimens shall be taken 
                longitudinally from the quarter points of the width near the outer end of the coil.

            L. DESIGN FOR SERVICEABILITY 
               This chapter addresses the serviceability determination using the Effective Width Method and 
            Direct Strength Method, and flange curling. 
               The chapter is organized as follows: 
              L1 Serviceability Determination for the Effective Width Method 
              L2 Serviceability Determination for the Direct Strength Method 
              L3 Flange Curling 
             
               Reduced stiffness values used in the direct analysis method, described in Chapter C, are not 
            intended for use with the provisions of this chapter. 
               
            L1 Serviceability Determination for the Effective Width Method 

               The bending deflection at any moment, M, due to service loads is permitted to be determined 
            by using the effective moment of inertia, I eff , determined in accordance with Appendix 1. 
                
            L2 Serviceability Determination for the Direct Strength Method 

               The bending deflection at any moment, M, due to service loads is permitted to be determined 
            by reducing the gross moment of inertia, I g , to an effective moment of inertia for deflection, as 
            given in Eq. L2-1: 
              Ieff  = I g (M d /M) ≤ I g                                                     (Eq. L2-1) 
                where  
                Md  = Nominal flexural strength [resistance], M n , defined in Chapter F with Direct Strength 
                    Method, but with M y  replaced by M in all equations 
                M  = Moment due to service loads on member to be considered (M ≤ M y ) 
                 
            L3 Flange Curling 

               Where the flange of a flexural member is unusually wide and it is desired to limit the 
            maximum amount of curling or movement of the flange toward the neutral axis, Eq. L3-1 is 
            permitted to be applied to compression and tension flanges, either stiffened or unstiffened, as 
            follows: 
              wf  =                     )d/c100(f/tdE061.0          4av     f                                             (Eq. L3-1) 
                where 
                wf   = Width of flange projecting beyond web, or half of distance between webs for box- or U-
                    type beams 
                t   = Flange thickness 
                d  = Depth of beam 
                E  =   Modulus of elasticity of steel 
                fav  =  Average stress in full unreduced flange width. (Where members are designed by the 
                    effective design width procedure, the average stress equals the maximum stress 
                    multiplied by the ratio of the effective design width to the actual width.) 
                cf   = Amount of curling displacement

            M.  DESIGN FOR FATIGUE 
               This chapter addresses cold-formed steel structural members and connections subject to cyclic 
            loading within the elastic range of stresses of frequency and magnitude sufficient to initiate 
            cracking and progressive failure, which defines the limit state of fatigue.  
               This chapter is organized as follows: 
              M1  General 
              M2  Calculation of Maximum Stresses and Stress Ranges 
              M3  Design Stress Range 
              M4  Bolts and Threaded Parts 
              M5  Special Fabrication Requirements 
             
            M1 General 

               When cyclic loading is a design consideration, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to 
            stresses calculated on the basis of ASD load combinations [specified loads]. The maximum permitted 
            tensile stress shall be 0.6 F y . 
               Stress range shall be defined as the magnitude of the change in stress due to the application 
            or removal of the live load [specified live load]. In the case of a stress reversal, the stress range shall 
            be computed as the sum of the absolute values of maximum repeated tensile and compressive 
            stresses or the sum of the absolute values of maximum shearing stresses of opposite direction at

               Fatigue need not be considered for seismic effects or for the effects of wind loading on 
            typical building lateral force-resisting systems and building enclosure components. Fatigue need 
            not be considered when the live load [specified live load] stress range is less than the threshold 
            stress range, F TH , given in Table M1-1. 
               Evaluation of fatigue strength [resistance] shall not be required if the number of cycles of 
            application of live load [specified live load] is less than 20,000. 
               The fatigue strength [resistance] determined by the provisions of this chapter shall be 
            applicable to structures with corrosion protection or subject only to non-aggressive 
            atmospheres. 
               The fatigue strength [resistance] determined by the provisions of this chapter shall be 
            applicable only to structures subject to temperatures not exceeding 300°F (149°C). 
               The contract documents shall either provide complete details including weld sizes, or

            M2 Calculation of Maximum Stresses and Stress Ranges 

               Calculated stresses shall be based upon elastic analysis. Stresses shall not be amplified by 
            stress concentration factors for geometrical discontinuities. 
               For bolts and threaded rods subject to axial tension, the calculated stresses shall include the 
            effects of prying action, if applicable. 
               In the case of axial stress combined with bending, the maximum stresses of each kind shall be 
            those determined for concurrent arrangements of applied load. 
               For members having symmetric cross-sections, the fasteners and welds shall be arranged 
            symmetrically about the axis of the member, or the total stresses including those due to 
            eccentricity shall be included in the calculation of the stress range. 
               For axially stressed angle members, where the center of gravity of the connecting welds lies 
            between the line of the center of gravity of the angle cross-section and the center of the 
            connected leg, the effects of eccentricity shall be ignored. If the center of gravity of the 
            connecting welds lies outside this zone, the total stresses, including those due to joint

               For mechanically fastened connections loaded in shear, the maximum range of stress in the 
            connected material shall not exceed the design stress range computed using Equation M3-1. The

            492 kg/cm 2 ). 
               For not-fully-tightened high-strength bolts, common bolts, and threaded anchor rods with

               This appendix addresses the Effective Width Method for elements on cold-formed steel cross-
            sections subject to compression stress. The effective section properties are used to determine the 
            member strengths and deflections.  
               This appendix is organized as follows:

                    (1) In considering global, distortional, and local buckling, f = F n  as determined in 
                       accordance with Chapter F.  
                    (2) In considering inelastic reserve, f is the stress in the compression element.  
                    (3) If Section F2.4.1 is used, f is the stress in the element considered at M n  determined 
                       on the basis of the effective section.

                w = Flat width 
                ρ = Local reduction factor determined by either of the following two procedures:  
                (1) Procedure I: 
                   A conservative estimate of the effective width is obtained from Section 1.1(a) by 
                substituting f d  for f, where f d  is the computed compressive stress in the element being 
                considered. 
                 (2) Procedure II: 
                   For stiffened elements supported by a web on each longitudinal edge, an improved 
                estimate of the effective width is obtained by calculating ρ as follows: 
                  ρ = 1   when λ ≤ 0.673 
                  ρ = (1.358 – 0.461/λ)/λ when 0.673 < λ < λc                              (Eq. 1.1-6)

              permitted to be determined using the following alternative methods, as applicable: 
                Alternative 1 for unstiffened C-sections: When the unsupported edge is in compression 
                   and the supported edge is in tension (Figure 1.2.2-3 (a)): 
                    b = w    when λ ≤ 0.856                                        (Eq. 1.2.2-8)

                      0.1 ≤ b o /h o  ≤ 1.0 
                Alternative 2 for unstiffened C-sections: When the supported edge is in compression and 
                   the unsupported edge is in tension (Figure 1.2.2-3(b)), the effective width is determined 
                   in accordance with Section 1.1.2. 










                                                                                               
                  Figure 1.2.2-3 Unstiffened Elements of C-Section Under Stress Gradient for Alternative Methods 

                 Where stress, f 1 , occurs at the unsupported edge as in Figures 1.2.2-1(b), 1.2.2-2(a), and 
              1.2.2-3(a), the design stress, f, shall be taken at the extreme fiber of the effective section, and f 1  
              is the calculated stress, based on the effective section, at the edge of the gross section. If the 
              only elements not fully effective are unstiffened elements with stress gradient, as in Figure 
              1.2.2-3(a), the stresses f 1  and f 2  are permitted to be based on the gross section, f taken equal to 
              f1 , and iteration is not required. 
                 In calculating the effective section modulus, S e , in Section F3.1, the extreme compression 
              fiber in Figures 1.2.2-1(b), 1.2.2-2(a), and 1.2.2-3(a) shall be taken as the edge of the effective 
              section closer to the unsupported edge, and the extreme tension fiber in Figures 1.2.2-2(b) and 
              1.2.2-3(b) shall be taken as the edge of the effective section closer to the unsupported edge.

              1.4.2 Edge-Stiffened Elements With Intermediate Stiffener(s) 

              (a) Strength Determination 
                 For edge-stiffened elements with intermediate stiffener(s), the effective width, b e , shall be 
              determined as follows: 
                 If b o /t ≤ 0.328S, the element is fully effective and no local buckling reduction is required. 
                   If b o /t > 0.328S, the plate buckling coefficient, k, is determined in accordance with 
                   Section 1.3, but with b o  replacing w in all expressions: 
                     If k calculated from Section 1.3 is less than 4.0 (k < 4), the intermediate stiffener(s) is 
                     ignored and the provisions of Section 1.3 are followed for calculation of the effective 
                     width. 
                     If k calculated from Section 1.3 is equal to 4.0 (k = 4), the effective width of the edge-
                     stiffened element is calculated from the provisions of Section 1.4.1, with the 
                     following exception: 
                     R calculated in accordance with Section 1.4.1 is less than or equal to 1. 
                      where 
                     b o  = Total flat width of edge-stiffened element 
                  See Sections 1.3 and 1.4.1 for definitions of other variables. 
              (b) Serviceability Determination 
                 The effective width, b d , used in determining serviceability shall be calculated as in Section 
              1.4.2(a), except that f d  is substituted for f, where f d  is the computed compressive stress in the 
              element being considered based on the effective section at the load for which serviceability is 
              determined.

            APPENDIX 2, ELASTIC BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF MEMBERS 
               This appendix addresses the elastic buckling stress and stress resultant (force or moment) that 
            are used for the determination of member strength in the Specification.  
               Elastic buckling occurs at a load in which the equilibrium of the member (approximated with 
            linear elastic material) is neutral between two alternative states: buckled and straight. Thin-
            walled cold-formed steel members may have at least three relevant elastic buckling modes: local, 
            distortional, and global. The global buckling mode includes flexural, torsional, or flexural-torsional 
            buckling for columns, and lateral-torsional buckling for beams. This appendix provides a means to 
            determine all three relevant buckling modes for use in the design process. 
             
               This appendix is organized as follows: 
              2.1 General Provisions 
              2.2 Numerical Solutions 
              2.3 Analytical Solutions 
             
            2.1  General Provisions  

               The elastic buckling stresses or elastic buckling stress resultants (forces or moments) that are 
            used in the Specification Chapters D through H are permitted to be calculated numerically in 
            accordance with Section 2.2, analytically in accordance with Section 2.3, or in any combination.  
               In compression, global, local, and distortional buckling conversion between force and stress 
            shall use the gross area, except where a reduced (e.g., net or effective) area is explicitly required 
            by the Specification. Therefore:

                where 
                Pcr   =   P cre —global (flexural, torsional, or flexural-torsional), P cr —local, or P crd —distortional

                  User Note:  
                  The Specification uses both stress and stress resultants (force, moment, etc.) in elastic buckling 
                  analysis. In particular, Effective Width Method calculations (e.g., Section E3.1) and traditional 
                  column and beam  buckling  formulas use stress (F cr ), while the Direct Strength Method (e.g., Section 
                  E3.2) uses stress resultants (P cr ). Numerical solutions are also performed as stress or stress 
                  resultants; either is adequate, but conversion of results between stress and stress resultant may be 
                  needed in order to use Specification equations. 
             
            2.2  Numerical Solutions 

               Any numerical elastic buckling solution that includes the relevant mechanics for the buckling 
            mode under consideration is permitted to be utilized.  
                  User Note:  
                  A number of numerical methods, and related software programs, are known to be accurate for 
                  local, distortional, and global buckling, including the finite strip method utilizing plate bending 
                  strips for discretizing the cross-section, the finite element method utilizing plate or shell finite 
                  elements for discretizing the cross-section, and generalized beam theory with appropriate cross-
                  section modes added for local and distortional buckling. See the Commentary for greater elaboration 
                  on the application of these numerical methods, including methods for members with holes, 
                  members with bracing, etc. 
               For local buckling, the impact of plate bending and cross-sectional distortion on the elastic 
            buckling mode shall be considered.  
               For distortional buckling, the impact of plate bending and cross-sectional distortion, including 
            distortion resulting from longitudinal strains, shall be considered.  
               For shear buckling (a specialized case of local or distortional buckling or both), the interaction of 
            shear and longitudinal stresses on plate bending and cross-sectional distortion shall be 
            considered.  
               For global buckling, the interaction of bending and torsion (i.e., flexural-torsional buckling or 
            lateral-torsional buckling), particularly for cross-sections that are not doubly symmetric, shall be 
            considered. 
                  User Note:  
                  Most conventional beam finite elements used in structural analysis software do not include the 
                  interaction of bending and torsion and should be used with care for global elastic buckling 
                  determination. 
             
            2.3  Analytical Solutions 

               The analytical solutions described in this section are permitted to be used for the given 
            boundary conditions and cross-section geometry. For other boundary conditions or cross-
            section geometry, numerical analysis as detailed in Section 2.2 shall be used.

                          section, including non-symmetric sections, F cre  is determined as the smallest root

                  Determining the local buckling force by using the smallest of the element (flange, web, lip, etc.) local 
                  buckling stresses can be very conservative if one element is much more slender than the rest of the

            PREFACE TO APPENDIX A 
               Specification Chapters A through M contain design provisions that are applicable to Canada, 
            Mexico, and the United States, and accommodate those provisions that may be partially 
            applicable to certain countries. Appendix A provides Specification provisions that apply only to 
            the United States and Mexico. 
             
               Also included in Appendix A are technical items where full agreement between countries 
            was not reached. Such items include certain provisions pertaining to the design of:  
              (a) Beams and compression members (C- and Z-sections) for standing seam roofs, and 
              (b) Bolted and welded connections. 
               Efforts are being made to minimize these differences in future editions of the Specification.

            APPENDIX A, PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO 
               Specification Chapters A through M contain design provisions that are applicable to Canada, 
            Mexico, and the United States, and accommodate those provisions that may be partially 
            applicable to certain countries. This appendix addresses design provisions or supplements to 
            Chapters A through M that specifically apply to the United States and Mexico. This appendix is 
            considered mandatory for applications in the United States and Mexico.  
               A section number ending with the letter “a” indicates that the provisions herein supplement 
            the corresponding section in Chapters A through M of the Specification. A section number not 
            ending with the letter “a” indicates that the section gives the entire design provision. 
             
                                                                                           I6.2.2 Flexural Members Having One Flange Fastened to a Standing Seam Roof System 

                   The available flexural strength of a C- or Z-section, loaded in a plane parallel to the web 
                with the top flange supporting a standing seam roof system, shall be determined using 
                discrete point bracing and the provisions of Section F3, or shall be calculated in accordance 
                with this section, where consideration of distortional buckling in accordance with Section F4 
                is permitted to be excluded.  
                   The safety factor and the resistance factor provided in this section shall be applied to the 
                nominal strength, M n , calculated by Eq. I6.2.2-1 to determine the available strengths in 
                accordance with the applicable design method in Section B3.2.1 or B3.2.2.

                      Roof 

                   These provisions shall apply to Z-sections  concentrically loaded along their 
                longitudinal axis, with only one flange  attached to standing seam roof panels. 
                Alternatively, design values for a particular system are permitted to be based on discrete 
                point bracing locations, or on tests in accordance with Section K2. 
                   The nominal axial strength, P n , of simple span or continuous Z-sections shall be 
                calculated in accordance with (a) and (b). Consideration of distortional buckling in 
                accordance with Section E4 is permitted to be excluded. 
                   Unless otherwise specified, the safety factor and the resistance factor provided in this 
                section shall be used to determine the available strengths in accordance with the applicable 
                design method in Section B3.2.1 or B3.2.2.

            PREFACE TO APPENDIX B  

               Specification Chapters A through M contain design provisions that are applicable to Canada, 
            Mexico, and the United States, and accommodate those provisions that may be partially 
            applicable to certain countries. This appendix addresses Specification provisions that are 
            applicable only to Canada.  
               While this document is referred to as a “Specification,” in Canada it is considered a 
            “Standard.” 
               Also included in Appendix B are technical items where full agreement between the three 
            countries was not reached. The most noteworthy of these items are the following: 
               (a)  Beams (C- and Z-sections) for standing seam roofs, 
               (b) Bolted and welded connections, and 
               (c)  Lateral and stability bracing. 
            Efforts will be made to minimize these differences in future editions of the Specification.  
               In Canada, SI units are the units of record for the purpose of this Specification.

            APPENDIX B,  PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO CANADA 
               Specification Chapters A through M contain design provisions that are applicable to Canada, 
            Mexico, and the United States, and accommodate those provisions that may be partially 
            applicable to certain countries. This appendix is considered mandatory for applications in 
            Canada.  
               A section number ending with the letter “a” indicates that the provisions herein supplement 
            the corresponding section in Chapters A through M of the Specification. A section number not 
            ending with the letter “a” indicates that the section gives the entire design provision. 
             
                                                                                           C2a Lateral and Stability Bracing 

               Structural members and assemblies shall be adequately braced to prevent collapse and to 
            maintain their integrity during the anticipated service life of the structure. Care shall be taken to 
            ensure that the bracing of the entire structural system is complete, particularly when there is 
            interdependence between walls, floors, or roofs acting as diaphragms. 
               Erection diagrams shall show the details of the essential bracing requirements, including 
            any details necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the bracing or bracing system. 
               The spacing of braces shall not be greater than the unbraced length assumed in the design of 
            the member or component being braced. 
             
              C2.1 Symmetrical Beams and Columns 

                 Discrete bracing of axially loaded compression members shall meet the requirements 
              specified in Section C2.3 of the Specification. In addition, the provisions of Sections C2.1.1 and 
              C2.1.2 of this appendix shall apply to symmetric sections in compression or bending in which 
              the applied load does not induce twist. 
             
                C2.1.1 Discrete Bracing for Beams 

                   The factored resistance of braces shall be at least 2 percent of the factored compressive 
                force in the compressive flange of a member in bending at the braced location. When more 
                than one brace acts at a common location and the nature of the braces is such that 
                combined action is possible, the bracing force may be shared proportionately. The 
                slenderness ratio of compressive braces shall not exceed 200. 
             
                C2.1.2 Bracing by Deck, Slab, or Sheathing for Beams and Columns 

                   The factored resistance of the attachments along the entire length of the braced member 
                shall be at least 5 percent of either the maximum factored compressive force in a 
                compressive member or the maximum factored compressive force in the compressive 
                flange of a member in bending. 
             
              C2.2a  C-Section and Z-Section Beams 

                 The provisions of Sections C2.2.2, C2.2.3, and C2.2.4 of this appendix apply to members in 
              bending in which the applied load in the plane of the web induces twist. Braces shall be 
              designed to avoid local crippling at the points of attachment to the member.

                C2.2.2 Discrete Bracing 

                   Braces shall be connected so as to effectively restrain both flanges of the section at the 
                ends and at intervals not greater than one-quarter of the span length in such a manner as to 
                prevent tipping at the ends and lateral deflection of either flange in either direction at the 
                intermediate braces. Fewer braces may be used if this approach can be shown to be 
                acceptable by rational engineering analysis, testing, or Section I6.2.1 of the Specification, 
                taking into account the effects of both lateral and torsional displacements.  
                   If fewer braces are used (when shown to be acceptable by rational engineering analysis or 
                testing), those sections used as purlins with "floating"-type roof sheathings that allow for 
                expansion and contraction independent of the purlins shall have a minimum of one brace 
                per bay for spans ≤ 7 m and two braces per bay for spans > 7 m.  
                   If one-third or more of the total load on the member is concentrated over a length of 
                one-twelfth or less of the span of the beam, an additional brace shall be placed at or near 
                the centre of this loaded length. 
             
                C2.2.3 One Flange Braced by Deck, Slab, or Sheathing 

                   The factored resistance of the attachment of the continuous deck, slab, or sheathing shall 
                be in accordance with Section C2.1.2 of this appendix. Discrete bracing shall be provided to 
                restrain the flange that is not braced by the deck, slab, or sheathing. The spacing of discrete 
                bracing shall be in accordance with Section C2.2.2 of this appendix. 
             
                C2.2.4 Both Flanges Braced by Deck, Slab, or Sheathing 

                   The factored resistance of the attachment shall be as given by Section C2.1.2 of this 
                appendix. 
                                                                                           I6.2.2 Flexural Members Having One Flange Fastened to a Standing Seam Roof System 

                   This type of member shall have discrete bracing in accordance with Section C2.2.2 of 
                this appendix. 
                                                                                           J2a  Welded Connections 

               Fabricators and erectors performing arc welding shall comply with the requirements of CSA 
            W47.1 (Division 1 or Division 2). The work may be sublet to a Division 3 fabricator or erector; 
            however, the Division 1 or Division 2 fabricator or erector shall retain responsibility for the 
            sublet work. Fabricators and erectors performing resistance welding shall comply with the 
            requirements of CSA W55.3. 
            Note: In Canada, accreditation of welding inspection bodies is provided by the Standards 
                 Council of Canada. 
               Where at least one of the connected parts is between 0.70 mm and 4.76 mm in base steel 
            thickness, welding shall conform to the requirements contained herein and shall be performed in 
            accordance with the applicable requirements of CSA W59. Except as provided in Section J2.2 of 
            the Specification, where at least one of the connected parts is less than 0.70 mm in base steel 
            thickness, welds shall be considered to have no structural value unless a value is substantiated 
            by appropriate tests. For arc spot welds connecting sheets to a thicker supporting member, the 
            applicable base steel thickness limits shall be 0.70 mm to 5.84 mm.

               The resistance in tension or compression of butt welds shall be the same as that prescribed 
            for the lower strength of base metal being joined. The butt weld shall fully penetrate the joint.  
                                                                                           J3.4  Shear and Tension in Bolts

                                             DISCLAIMER 

               The material contained herein has been developed by a joint effort of the American Iron and 
            Steel Institute (AISI) Committee on Specifications, the CSA Group Technical Committee on 
            Cold Formed Steel Structural Members (S136), and Camara Nacional de la Industria del Hierro 
            y del Acero (CANACERO) in Mexico. The organizations and the Committees have made a 
            diligent effort to present accurate, reliable, and useful information on cold-formed steel design. 
            The Committees acknowledge and are grateful for the contributions of the numerous 
            researchers, engineers, and others who have contributed to the body of knowledge on the 
            subject. Specific references are included in the Commentary on the Specification. 
                With anticipated improvements in understanding of the behavior of cold-formed steel and 
            the continuing development of new technology, this material may eventually become dated. It 
            is anticipated that future editions of this Specification will update this material as new 
            information becomes available, but this cannot be guaranteed. 
                The materials set forth herein are for general information only. They are not a substitute 
            for competent professional advice. Application of this information to a specific project should 
            be reviewed by a registered professional engineer. Indeed, in most jurisdictions, such review is 
            required by law. Anyone making use of the information set forth herein does so at their own 
            risk and assumes any and all resulting liability arising therefrom.

                                              PREFACE 
             
               This document provides a commentary on the 2016 edition of the North American 
            Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members.  
               The purpose of the Commentary is: (a) to provide a record of the reasoning behind, and 
            justification for, the various provisions of the North American Specification by cross-referencing 
            the published supporting research data, and to discuss the changes made in the current 
            Specification; (b) to offer a brief but coherent presentation of the characteristics and performance 
            of cold-formed steel structures to structural engineers and other interested individuals; (c) to 
            furnish the background material for a study of cold-formed steel design methods to educators 
            and students; and (d) to provide the needed information to those who will be responsible for 
            future revisions of the Specification. The readers who wish to have more complete information, 
            or who may have questions which are not answered by the abbreviated presentation of this 
            Commentary, should refer to the original research publications.  
               Consistent with the Specification, the Commentary contains a main document, Chapters A 
            through M, Appendices 1 and 2, and the country-specific provisions Appendices A and B. A 
            symbol  A,B  is used in the main document to point out that additional discussions are 
            provided in the corresponding country-specific provisions in Appendices A or B.  
               AISI appreciates the tremendous efforts of the committee members in reorganizing the 
            whole Specification and the Commentary. Special thanks go to Mr. Richard Kaehler, who 
            developed the outline; and Dr. Benjamin Schafer, who provided leadership in reorganizing the 
            Specification and Commentary. Appreciation is extended to Chairman Roger Brockenbrough and 
            Vice Chairman Richard Haws for their lasting contributions to the AISI Committee of 
            Specifications.

                         COMMENTARY ON THE NORTH AMERICAN SPECIFICATION  
                     FOR THE DESIGN OF COLD-FORMED STEEL STRUCTURAL MEMBERS 

            INTRODUCTION 
               Cold-formed steel members have been used economically for building construction and 
            other applications (Winter, 1959a, 1959b; Yu and LaBoube, 2010). These types of sections are 
            cold-formed from steel sheet, strip, plate or flat bar in roll-forming machines or by press brake 
            or bending operations. The thicknesses of steel sheets or strips generally used for cold-formed steel 
            structural members range from 0.0147 in. (0.373 mm) to about 1/4 in. (6.35 mm). Steel plates and 
            bars as thick as 1 in. (25.4 mm) can be cold-formed successfully into structural shapes.  
               In general, cold-formed steel structural members can offer several advantages for building 
            construction (Winter, 1970; Yu and LaBoube, 2010): (1) Light members can be manufactured for 
            relatively light loads and/or short spans, (2) Unusual sectional configurations can be produced 
            economically by cold-forming operations and consequently favorable strength-to-weight ratios 
            can be obtained, (3) Load-carrying panels and decks can provide useful surfaces for floor, roof 
            and wall construction, and in some cases they can also provide enclosed cells for electrical and 
            other conduits, and (4) Panels and decks not only withstand loads normal to their surfaces, but 
            they can also act as shear diaphragms to resist forces in their own planes if they are adequately 
            interconnected to each other and to supporting members. 
               The use of cold-formed steel members in building construction began around the 1850s. 
            However, in North America, such steel members were not widely used in buildings until the 
            publication of the first edition of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) Specification in 
            1946 (AISI, 1946). This first design standard was primarily based on the research work 
            sponsored by AISI at Cornell University since 1939. It was revised subsequently by the AISI 
            Committee in 1956, 1960, 1962, 1968, 1980, and 1986 to reflect the technical developments and 
            the results of continuing research. In 1991, AISI published the first edition of the Load and 
            Resistance Factor Design Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI, 1991). Both 
            Allowable Stress Design (ASD) and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specifications were 
            combined into a single document in 1996.  
               In Canada, the CSA Group (CSA) published its first edition of Design of Light Gauge Steel 
            Structural Members in 1963 based on the 1962 edition of the AISI Specification. Subsequent 
            editions were published in 1974, 1984, 1989 and 1994. The Canadian Standard for Cold Formed 
            Steel Structural Members (CSA, 1994) was based on the Limit States Design (LSD) method. 
               In Mexico, cold-formed steel structural members have also been designed on the basis of AISI 
            Specifications. The 1962 edition of the AISI Design Manual (AISI, 1962) was translated into 
            Spanish in 1965 (Camara, 1965). 
               The first edition of the North American Specification (AISI, 2001), applicable to the United 
            States, Canada and Mexico, was published in 2001. This 2001 edition of the Specification was 
            developed on the basis of the 1996 AISI Specification with the 1999 Supplement (AISI, 1996, 1999), 
            the 1994 CSA Standard (CSA, 1994), and subsequent developments. In the North American 
            Specification, the ASD and LRFD methods are used in the United States and Mexico, while the 
            LSD method is used in Canada. The North American Specification was revised and updated in 
            2004, 2007, 2010, and 2012 (AISI, 2004; AISI, 2007; AISI, 2010; and AISI, 2012) as new technology 
            was adopted. The Direct Strength Method was introduced in 2004 (AISI, 2004) as an alternative 
            design method. The second-order analysis of structural systems was added in 2007 (AISI, 2007).

            In the 2012 edition of the Specification, the added design provisions included the design of 
            power-actuated fasteners and the Direct Strength Method for determining compression and flexural 
            strength of perforated members, shear strength for non-perforated members, and member 
            reserve capacities. 
               In 2016, the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members 
            was reorganized—The Direct Strength Method was moved into Chapters D through H of the 
            Specification and is considered as an equivalent design method to the Effective Width Method; the 
            provisions for determining the effective width of elements were moved into Appendix 1; and the 
            determination of buckling loads was moved into Appendix 2. The provisions were reorganized to 
            be consistent, where possible, with the layout of the AISC Specification. Accordingly, the 
            Commentary on the Specification has also been revised and reorganized. 
               In addition to the issuance of the design Specification, AISI also published the first edition of 
            the Design Manual in 1949 (AISI, 1949). This Allowable Stress Design manual was revised in 1956, 
            1961, 1962, 1968, 1977, 1983, and 1986. In 1991, the LRFD Design Manual was published for using 
            the Load and Resistance Factor Design criteria. The AISI 1996 Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual was 
            prepared for the combined AISI ASD and LRFD Specifications. The Cold-Formed Steel Design 
            Manual was updated in 2002, 2008 and 2013 (AISI, 2002; AISI, 2008; AISI, 2012) as the 
            Specification was revised (AISI, 2001; AISI, 2007; AISI 2012). 
               During the period from 1958 through 1983, AISI published Commentaries on several editions 
            of the AISI design Specifications, which were prepared by Professor George Winter of Cornell 
            University in 1958, 1961, 1962, and 1970. Since 1983, the format used for the AISI Commentary 
            has been such that the same section numbers are used for the Commentary as for the Specification. 
            The Commentary on the 1996 AISI Specification was prepared by Professor Wei-Wen Yu of the 
            University of Missouri-Rolla (Yu, 1996). The 2001 edition of the Commentary (AISI, 2001) was 
            based on the Commentary for the 1996 AISI Specification.  
               The current edition of the Commentary is updated for the 2016 edition of the North American 
            Specification. It contains Chapters A through M, Appendices 1 and 2, and Appendices A and B, 
            where commentary on provisions that are only applicable to a specific country is included in 
            the corresponding lettered appendix. 
               As in previous editions of the Commentary, this document contains a brief presentation of 
            the characteristics and performance of cold-formed steel structural members, connections and 
            assemblies. In addition, it provides a record of the reasoning behind, and the justification for, 
            various provisions of the Specification. A cross-reference is provided between various design 
            provisions and the published research data. 
               In this edition of the Commentary, the majority of the technical contents in the 2012 edition of 
            the Commentary have been retained. However, due to the content reorganization, readers may 
            refer back to the 2012 edition of the Commentary for some specific changes made prior to the 
            2016 edition of the Specification.  
               In this Commentary, the individual sections, equations, figures, and tables are identified by 
            the same notation as in the Specification and the material is presented in the same sequence. 
            Bracketed terms used in the Commentary are equivalent terms that apply particularly to the LSD 
            method in Canada. 
               The Specification and Commentary are intended for use by design professionals with 
            demonstrated engineering competence in their fields.

            A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 
            A1  Scope, Applicability, and Definitions 

              A1.1 Scope  

                 The cross-sectional configurations, manufacturing processes and fabrication practices of 
              cold-formed steel structural members differ in several respects from those of hot-rolled steel 
              shapes. For cold-formed steel sections, the forming process is performed at, or near, room 
              temperature by the use of bending brakes, press brakes, or roll-forming machines. Some of 
              the significant differences between cold-formed sections and hot-rolled shapes are: (1) 
              absence of the residual stresses caused by uneven cooling due to hot-rolling, (2) lack of corner 
              fillets, (3) presence of increased yield stress with decreased proportional limit and ductility 
              resulting from cold-forming, (4) presence of cold-reducing stresses when cold-rolled steel 
              stock has not been finally annealed, (5) prevalence of elements having large width-to-thickness 
              ratios, (6) rounded corners, and (7) different characteristics of stress-strain curves that can be 
              either the sharp-yielding type or gradual-yielding type. 
                 The Specification is applicable only to cold-formed sections not more than 1 inch (25.4 mm) 
              in thickness. Research conducted at the University of Missouri-Rolla (Yu, Liu, and McKinney, 
              1973b and 1974) has verified the applicability of the Specification’s provisions for such cases. 
                 In view of the fact that most of the design provisions have been developed on the basis of 
              experimental work subject to static loading, the Specification is intended for the design of cold-
              formed steel structural members to be used for load-carrying purposes in buildings. For 
              structures other than buildings, appropriate allowances should be made for dynamic effects. 
                  
              A1.2 Applicability 

                 The Specification (AISI, 2012a) is limited to the design of steel structural members cold-
              formed from carbon or low-alloy sheet, strip, plate or bar. The design can be made by using 
              either the Allowable Strength Design (ASD) method or the Load and Resistance Factor Design 
              (LRFD) method for the United States and Mexico. Only the Limit States Design (LSD) method 
              is permitted in Canada.  
                 In this Commentary, the bracketed terms are equivalent terms that apply particularly to 
              LSD. A symbol  x  is used to point out that additional provisions are provided in the 
              country-specific appendices as indicated by the letter, x.  
                 Because of the diverse forms of cold-formed steel structural members and connections, it is not 
              possible to cover all design configurations by the design rules presented in the Specification. 
              For those special cases where the available strength [factored resistance] and/or stiffness cannot 
              be determined, it can be established by:  
              (a) Testing in accordance with the provisions of Section K2.1.1(a),  
              (b) Rational engineering analysis and confirmatory testing evaluated in accordance with the 
                 provisions of Section K2.1.1(b), or  
              (c) Rational engineering analysis only in accordance with the provisions of Section A1.2(c). 
                 Prior to 2001, the only option in such cases was testing. Since 2001, in recognition of the 
                 fact that this was not always practical or necessary, the rational engineering analysis options 
                 were added. It is essential that such analysis be based on theory that is appropriate for the 
                 situation and sound engineering judgment. Specification Section A1.2(b) was added for

                 components that have significant geometric variations such that it becomes impractical to 
                 test each variation in accordance with Specification Section A1.2(a). This is particularly 
                 useful when the following applies: 
                  (1) A form of cold-formed steel component is being evaluated that is outside the scope 
                     of the Specification, 
                  (2) The member or assembly being evaluated has a degree of variation, such as 
                     variations in cross-sectional dimensions, that makes it impractical to test each 
                     individual variation, 
                  (3) More accurate safety and resistance factors than those prescribed by Section A1.2(c) are 
                     desired, and  
                  (4) A test program can be conducted in accordance with Section K2. 
                 In any case, safety and resistance factors given in Specification Section A1.2(c) should not be 
              used if applicable safety factors or resistance factors in Specification Chapters A through M, 
              Appendices 1 and 2, and Appendices A and B are more conservative. These provisions must 
              not be used to circumvent the intent of the Specification. Where the provisions of Chapters B 
              through J and L through M of the Specification and Appendices A and B apply, those 
              provisions must be used and cannot be avoided by testing or rational engineering analysis. 
                 In order to provide better alignment between the testing provisions of Section K2 and the 
              provisions for rational engineering analysis, the safety factor for the rational engineering analysis of 
              connections was adjusted upward from Ω=2.5 to Ω=3.0 in 2016. Compatible adjustments were 
              also made to the accompanying resistance factors, φ, for rational engineering analysis. 
                  
              A1.3 Definitions 

                 Many of the definitions in Specification Section A1.3 for ASD, LRFD and LSD are self-
              explanatory. Only those which are not self-explanatory are briefly discussed below. 
                  
              General Terms 

              Effective Design Width 
                 The effective design width is a concept which facilitates taking account of local buckling and 
                 post-buckling strength for compression elements. The effect of shear lag on short, wide 
                 flanges is also handled by using an effective design width. These matters are treated in 
                 Specification Appendix 1, and the corresponding effective widths are discussed in the 
                 Commentary on that appendix. 
              Multiple-Stiffened Elements 
                 Multiple-stiffened elements of two cross-sections are shown in Figure C-A1.3-1. Each of the 
                 two outer sub-elements of cross-section (1) is stiffened by a web and an intermediate 
                 stiffener while the middle sub-element is stiffened by two intermediate stiffeners. The 
                 two sub-elements of cross-section (2) are stiffened by a web and the attached intermediate 
                 middle stiffener. 
              Stiffened or Partially Stiffened Compression Elements 
                 Stiffened compression elements of various cross-sections are shown in Figure C-A1.3-2 in 
                 which Cross-sections (1) through (5) are for flexural members, and Cross-sections (6) 
                 through (9) are for compression members. Cross-sections (1) and (2) each have a web and

                 a lip to stiffen the compression element (i.e., the compression flange), the ineffective 
                 portion of which is shown shaded. For the explanation of these ineffective portions, see 
                 the discussion of Effective Design Width and Appendix 1. Cross-sections (3), (4), and (5) 
                 show compression elements stiffened by two webs. Cross-sections (6) and (8) show edge-
                 stiffened flange elements that have a vertical element (web) and an edge stiffener (lip) to 
                 stiffen the elements while the web itself is stiffened by the flanges. Cross-section (7) has 
                 four compression elements stiffening each other, and cross-section (9) has each stiffened 
                 element stiffened by a lip and the other stiffened element.

              Thickness 
                 In calculating section properties, the reduction in thickness that occurs at corner bends is 
                 ignored, and the base metal thickness of the flat steel stock, exclusive of coatings, is used in 
                 all calculations for load-carrying purposes. 
              Flexural-Torsional Buckling 
                 The 1968 edition of the Specification pioneered methods for computing column loads of 
                 cold-formed steel cross-sections prone to buckling by simultaneous twisting and bending. 
                 This complex behavior may result in lower column loads than would result from primary 
                 buckling by flexure alone.

              Unstiffened Compression Elements 
                 Unstiffened elements of various cross-sections are shown in Figure C-A1.3-3, in which 
                 Cross-sections (1) through (4) are for flexural members and cross-sections (5) through (8) 
                 are for compression members. Cross-sections (1), (2), and (3) have only a web to stiffen the 
                 compression flange element. The legs of Cross-section (4) provide mutual stiffening action 
                 to each other along their common edges. Cross-sections (5), (6), and (7), acting as 
                 columns, have vertical stiffened elements (webs) which provide support for one edge of 
                 the unstiffened flange elements. The legs of Cross-section (8) provide mutual stiffening 
                 action to each other. 
               
              ASD and LRFD Terms (United States and Mexico) 

              ASD (Allowable Strength Design, formerly referred to as Allowable Stress Design) 
                 Allowable Strength Design (ASD) is a method of designing structural components such that 
                 the allowable strength (force or moment) permitted by various sections of the Specification is 
                 not exceeded when the structure is subjected to all appropriate loads and load 
                 combinations in accordance with Specification Section B2. See also Specification Section 
                 B3.2.1 for ASD requirements. 
              LRFD (Load and Resistance Factor Design) 
                 Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) is a method of designing structural components 
                 such that the applicable limit state is not exceeded when the structure is subjected to all 
                 appropriate loads and load combinations in accordance with Specification Section B2. See 
                 also Specification Section B3.2.2 for LRFD requirements. 
             
              LSD Terms (Canada) 

              LSD (Limit States Design) 
                 Limit States Design (LSD) is a method of designing structural components such that the 
                 applicable limit state is not exceeded when the structure is subjected to all appropriate 
                 loads and load combinations in accordance with Specification Section B2. See also 
                 Specification Section B3.2.3 for LSD requirements. 
                 In the Specification, the terminologies for Limit States Design (LSD) are given in brackets 
              parallel to those for Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD). The inclusion of LSD 
              terminology is intended to help engineers who are familiar with LSD better understand the 
              Specification. 
                 It should be noted that the design concept used for the LRFD and the LSD methods is the 
              same, except that the load factors, load combinations, assumed dead-to-live load ratios, and 
              target reliability indexes are slightly different. In most cases, same nominal strength [resistance] 
              equations are used for ASD, LRFD, and LSD approaches.

                 The nondimensional character of the majority of the Specification provisions is intended to 
              facilitate design in any compatible systems of units (U.S. customary, SI or metric, and MKS 
              systems).  
                 The conversion of U.S. customary into SI metric units and MKS systems are given in 
              parentheses throughout the entire text of the Specification and Commentary. Table C-A1.4-1 is a 
              conversion table for these three different units.

            A3 Material 

              A3.1 Applicable Steels 

                 ASTM International and CSA Group are the basic sources of steel designations for use 
              with the Specification. Specification Section A3.1 contains the complete list of steel standards 
              that are accepted by the Specification. Dates of issue are included in Specification Section A2.  
                 In 2012, the list of applicable steels was enhanced by categorizing them into three groups 
              based on the specified minimum elongation in a 2-inch (50-mm) gage length: ten (10) percent 
              or greater elongation, three (3) percent to ten (10) percent elongation, and less than three (3) 
              percent elongation. This eliminated the need to identify specific steel grades in subsequent 
              sections. 
                 In the 1996 Specification, the ASTM A446 Standard was replaced by the ASTM 
              A653/A653M Standard. At the same time, the ASTM A283/A283M Standard, High-Strength, 
              Low-Alloy Steel (HSLAS) Grades 70 (480) and 80 (550) of ASTM A653/A653M and ASTM 
              A715 were added.  
                 In 2001, the ASTM A1008/A1008M and ASTM A1011/A1011M Standards replaced the 
              ASTM A570/A570M, ASTM A607, ASTM A611, and ASTM A715 Standards. ASTM 
              A1003/A1003M was added to the list of the applicable steels.  
                 In 2007, the ASTM A1039 Standard was added to the list of the applicable steels. For all 
              grades of steel, ASTM A1039 complies with the minimum required F u /F y  ratio of 1.08. 
              Thicknesses equal to or greater than 0.064 in. (1.6 mm) and less than or equal to 0.078 in. (2.0 
              mm) also meet the minimum elongation requirements of Specification Section A3.1.1 and no 
              reduction in the specified minimum yield stress is required. However, steel thicknesses less than 
              0.064 in. (1.6 mm) with yield stresses greater than 55 ksi (380 MPa) do not meet the 
              requirements of Specification Section A3.1.1 and are subject to the limitations of Specification 
              Section A3.1.2. 
                 In 2012, the ASTM A1063/A1063M Standard was added to the list of the applicable steels. 
              The ASTM A1063/A1063M Standard is intended to be a match to ASTM A653/A653M, but 
              the materials are produced using a “twin-roll casting process,” which is also used to produce 
              materials conforming to the ASTM A1039/A1039M Standard. 
                 The important material properties for the design of cold-formed steel members are yield 
              stress, tensile strength, and ductility. Ductility is the ability of steel to undergo sizable plastic or 
              permanent strains before fracturing and is important both for structural safety and for cold-
              forming. It is usually measured by the elongation in a 2-inch (50-mm) gage length. The ratio 
              of the tensile strength to the yield stress is also an important material property; this is an 
              indication of strain hardening and the ability of the material to redistribute stress.  
             
                A3.1.1 Steels With a Specified Minimum Elongation of Ten Percent or Greater  
                      (Elongation ≥ 10%) 

                   Material specifications for low-carbon sheet and strip steels with specified minimum yield 
                stress from 24 to 50 ksi (165 to 345 MPa or 1690 to 3520 kg/cm 2 ) provide specified 
                minimum elongations in a 2-inch (50-mm) gage length of 11 to 30 percent, thus easily 
                meeting the 10-percent minimum requirement for this category. Steels with yield stresses 
                higher than 50 ksi (345 MPa or 3520 kg/cm 2 ) are often produced as low-alloy steels in 
                order to meet these ductility requirements. Elongations are determined in accordance with

                ASTM test method A370 (A1058). 
                   For the listed standards, the yield stresses of steels range from 24 to 80 ksi (165 to 550 
                MPa or 1690 to 5620 kg/cm 2 ) and the tensile strengths vary from 42 to 100 ksi (290 to 690 
                MPa or 2950 to 7030 kg/cm 2 ). The tensile-to-yield ratios are not less than 1.13, and the 
                elongations are not less than 10 percent. The conditions for use of steels that have a defined 
                ductility of at least three percent (3%) are outlined in Specification Section A3.1.2. The 
                conditions for use of steels that have a defined ductility of less than three percent (3%) are 
                outlined in Specification Section A3.1.3. 
                   For ASTM A1003/A1003M steel, even though the minimum tensile strength is not 
                specified in the ASTM Standard for each of Types H and L steels, the footnote of Table 2 of 
                the Standard states that for Type H steels, the ratio of tensile strength to yield stress shall not 
                be less than 1.08. Thus, a conservative value of F u  = 1.08 F y  can be used for the design of 
                cold-formed steel members using Type H steels. Based on the same standard, a 
                conservative value of F u  = F y  can be used for the design of purlins and girts using Type L 
                steels. In 2004, the Specification listing of ASTM A1003/A1003M steel was revised to list 
                only the grades designated Type H, because this is the only grade that satisfies the criterion 
                for unrestricted usage. Grades designated Type L can still be used but are subject to the 
                restrictions of Specification Section A3.1.3. 
                   Certain grades of ASTM A653, A792, and A1039 have elongations that vary based upon 
                the thickness of the material. Exceptions are provided for those steels that do not belong to 
                the designated group.  
                    
                A3.1.2 Steels With a Specified Minimum Elongation From Three Percent to Less Than  
                      Ten Percent (3% ≤ Elongation < 10%) 

                   Steels listed in this section have specified minimum elongations less than the 10 percent 
                limitation for unlimited utilization within the Specification. However, they do have some 
                defined ductility.  
                   For the determination of the tension strength of members and connections in Grade 80 
                (550) Class 3 steels produced to ASTM A653/A653M and A792/A792M, tension tests on 
                sheet steels and shear tests on connections using steel produced to Australian Standard 
                AS1397 G550 (Standards Australia, 2001), which is similar in minimum ductility (2%) to 
                ASTM A792 Grade 80 (550) Class 3 (minimum ductility 3%), were performed at the 
                University of Sydney by Rogers and Hancock. These included sheet steels in tension with 
                and without perforations (Rogers and Hancock, 1997), bolted connections in shear (Rogers 
                and Hancock, 1998; Rogers and Hancock, 1999b), screw connections in shear (Rogers and 
                Hancock, 1999a), and sheet steel fracture toughness tests (Rogers and Hancock, 2001). 
                  
                A3.1.3 Steels With a Specified Minimum Elongation of Less Than Three Percent  
                      (Elongation < 3%) 

                   ASTM A653/A653M SS Grade 80 (550) Class 1 and 2; ASTM A792/A792M Grade 80 
                (550) Class 1 and 2; ASTM A875 SS Grade 80 (550); and ASTM A1008/A1008M SS Grade 
                80 (550) steels have a specified minimum yield stress of 80 ksi (550 MPa or 5620 kg/cm 2 ), a 
                specified minimum tensile strength of 82 ksi (565 MPa or 5770 kg/cm 2 ), and no stipulated 
                minimum elongation in a 2-inch (50-mm) gage length. These steels do not have adequate 
                ductility as defined by Specification Section A3.1.1. These low-ductility steels permit only

                limited amounts of cold forming, require fairly large corner radii, and have other limits on 
                their applicability for structural framing members. Their use has been limited in 
                Specification Section A3.1.3 to particular multiple-web configurations such as roofing, 
                siding, and floor decking. 
                   In the past, the yield stress used in design was limited to 75 percent of the specified 
                minimum yield stress, or 60 ksi (414 MPa or 4220 kg/cm 2 ), and the tensile strength used in 
                design was limited to 75 percent of the specified minimum tensile strength, or 62 ksi (427 
                MPa or 4360 kg/cm 2 ), whichever was lower. This introduced a higher safety factor, but still 
                made low-ductility steels, such as SS Grade 80 and Grade E, useful for the named 
                applications. 
                   Based on the UMR research findings (Wu, Yu, and LaBoube, 1996), Equation A3.1.3-1 
                was added in Specification Section A3.1.3 to determine the reduced yield stress, R b Fsy , for the 
                calculation of the nominal flexural strength [resistance] of multiple-web sections such as 
                roofing, siding and floor decking (AISI, 1999). For the unstiffened compression flange, 
                Equation A3.1.3-2 was added on the basis of a 1988 UMR study (Pan and Yu, 1988). This 
                revision allows the use of a higher nominal bending strength [resistance] than previous 
                editions of the Specification. When the multiple-web section is composed of both stiffened 
                and unstiffened compression flange elements, the smallest R b  should be used to determine 
                the reduced yield stress for use on the entire section. Different values of the reduced yield 
                stress could be used for positive and negative moments. 
                   The equations provided in Specification Section A3.1.3 can also be used for calculating 
                the nominal flexural strength [resistance] when the available strengths [factored resistances] are 
                determined on the basis of tests as permitted by rational engineering analysis. 
                   It should be noted that the exception clause in Specification Section A3.1 should be 
                followed for steel deck used for composite slabs when the deck is used as the tensile 
                reinforcement.  
                   For the calculation of web crippling strength of deck panels, although the UMR study 
                (Wu, Yu, and LaBoube, 1997) shows that the specified minimum yield stress can be used to 
                calculate the web crippling strength of deck panels, the Specification provides a more 
                conservative approach. The lesser of 0.75 F sy  and 60 ksi (414 MPa or 4220 kg/cm 2 ) is used 
                to determine both the web crippling strength (Specification Section G5) and the shear 
                strength (Specification Section G2) for the low-ductility steels. This is consistent with the 
                previous edition of the Specification. 
                   Another UMR study (Koka, Yu, and LaBoube, 1997) confirmed that for the connection 
                design using SS Grade 80 (550) of A653/A653M steel, the tensile strength used in design 
                should be taken as 75 percent of the specified minimum tensile strength or 62 ksi (427 MPa 
                or 4360 kg/cm 2 ), whichever is less. It should be noted that the current design provisions 
                are limited only to the design of members and connections subjected to static loading 
                without the considerations of fatigue strength. 
                 Load tests are permitted, but not for the purpose of using higher loads than can be 
              calculated under Specification Chapters D through M.

              A3.2 Other Steels 

                 Although the use of the steel standards listed in Specification Section A3.1 is encouraged, 
              other steels may also be used in cold-formed steel structures, provided they satisfy the 
              requirements stipulated in Specification Section A3.2. 
                 ASTM and CSA Group material standards include references to general requirements 
              standards that cover information such as dimensional tolerances and testing protocols that 
              are similar across a set of material standards to minimize duplication and inconsistencies. For 
              sheet steel used for cold-formed products, the typical general requirements standards are as 
              follows: 
                (a) For coated sheets, ASTM A924/A924M-14 or CSA G40.20-13, as applicable;  
                (b) For hot-rolled or cold-rolled sheet and strip, ASTM A568/A568M-15 or CSA G40.20-13, 
                   as applicable;  
                (c) For plate and bar, ASTM A6/A6M-14 or CSA G40.20-13, as applicable 
                (d) For hollow structural sections (carbon steel), ASTM A500/A500M -13 or CSA G40.20-
                   13, as applicable 
                (e) For hollow structural sections (HSLAS steel), ASTM A847/A847M-14 or CSA G40.20-
                   13, as applicable. 
                 In 2004, these requirements were clarified and revised. The Specification has long required 
              that such “other steels” conform to the chemical and mechanical requirements of one of the 
              listed specifications or “other published specification.” Specific requirements for a published 
              specification have been detailed in the definitions under Specification Section A1.3, General 
              Terms. It is important to note that, by this definition, published requirements must be 
              established before the steel is ordered, not by a post-order screening process. The 
              requirements must include minimum tensile properties, chemical composition limits, and for 
              coated sheets, coating properties. Testing procedures must be in accordance with the 
              referenced ASTM or CSA Group  specifications. A proprietary specification of a 
              manufacturer, purchaser, or producer could qualify as a published specification if it meets the 
              definition requirements.  
                 As an example of these Specification provisions, it would not be permissible to establish a 
              minimum yield stress or minimum tensile strength greater than that ordered to a standard 
              ASTM grade by reviewing mill test reports or conducting additional tests. However, it would 
              be permissible to publish a manufacturer’s or producer’s specification before the steel is 
              ordered requiring that such enhanced properties be furnished as a minimum. Testing to 
              verify that the minimum properties are achieved could be done by the manufacturer or the 
              producer. The intent of these provisions is to ensure that the material factor, M m  (see 
              Specification Section K2), will be maintained at about 1.10, corresponding to an assumed 
              typical 10 percent overrun in tensile properties for ASTM grades. 
                 Where the material is used for fabrication by welding, care must be exercised in selection 
              of chemical composition or mechanical properties to ensure compatibility with the welding 
              process and its potential effect on altering the tensile properties. 
                 Special additional requirements have been added to qualify unidentified material. In such 
              a case, the manufacturer must run tensile tests sufficient to establish that the yield stress and 
              tensile strength of each master coil are at least 10 percent greater than the applicable published 
              specification. As used here, master coil refers to the coil being processed by the manufacturer. 
              Of course, the testing must always be adequate to ensure that specified minimum properties

              are met, as well as the ductility requirements of Specification Section A3.1.1, A3.1.2, or A3.1.3 
              as desired. 
             
                A3.2.1 Ductility Requirements of Other Steels 

                   In 1968, because new steels of higher strengths were being developed, sometimes with 
                lower elongations, the question of how much elongation is really needed in a structure was 
                the focus of a study initiated at Cornell University. Steels were studied that had yield 
                strengths ranging from 45 to 100 ksi (310 to 690 MPa or 3160 to 7030 kg/cm 2 ), elongations 
                in 2 inches (50-mm) ranging from 50 to 1.3 percent, and tensile strength-to-yield strength 
                ratios ranging from 1.51 to 1.00 (Dhalla, Errera and Winter, 1971; Dhalla and Winter, 1974a; 
                Dhalla and Winter, 1974b). The investigators developed elongation requirements for 
                ductile steels. These measurements are more accurate but cumbersome to make; therefore, 
                the investigators recommended the following determination for adequately ductile steels: 
                (1) The tensile strength-to-yield strength ratio shall not be less than 1.08, and (2) The total 
                elongation in a 2-inch (50-mm) gage length shall not be less than 10 percent, or not less 
                than 7 percent in an 8-inch (200-mm) gage length. Also, the Specification limits the use of 
                Chapters D through J to adequately ductile steels. In lieu of the tensile strength-to-yield 
                strength limit of 1.08, the Specification permits the use of elongation requirements using the 
                measurement technique as given by Dhalla and Winter (1974a) (Yu and LaBoube, 2010). 
                Further information on the test procedure should be obtained from AISI S903, Standard 
                Methods for Determination of Uniform and Local Ductility (AISI, 2013b). Because of limited 
                experimental verification of the structural performance of members using materials having 
                a tensile strength-to-yield strength ratio less than 1.08 (Macadam et al., 1988), the Specification 
                limits the use of this material to purlins, girts, and curtain wall studs meeting the elastic 
                design requirements of Sections F2, F3, I6.2.1, I6.2.2, I6.3.1, and additional country-specific 
                requirements given in the appendices. Thus, the use of such steels in other applications is 
                prohibited. However, in purlins, girts, and curtain wall studs (with special country-specific 
                requirements given in the appendices), concurrent axial loads of relatively small 
                magnitude are acceptable providing the requirements of Specification Section H1.2 are met 
                and Ωc P/P n  does not exceed 0.15 for allowable strength design, P u /φc Pn  does not exceed 0.15 
                for the Load and Resistance Factor Design, and P f /φc Pn  does not exceed 0.15 for the Limit 
                States Design. 
                   In 2007, curtain wall studs were added to the applications for materials having a tensile 
                strength-to-yield strength ratio less than 1.08. Curtain wall studs are repetitive framing 
                members that are typically spaced more closely than purlins and girts. Curtain wall studs are 
                analogous to vertical girts; as such, they are not subjected to snow or other significant 
                sustained gravity loads.  
                   With the addition of the provisions of Specification Section A3.1.2 in 2012, the use of the 
                alternative approach for the limited range of structural usage is largely superseded by the 
                provisions of Specification Section A3.1.2. 
             
                  A3.2.1.1  Restrictions for Curtain Wall Studs 

                     Pending future research regarding the cyclic performance of connections, an 
                  exception is noted on use of lower ductility steels as defined in Section A3.2.1 for curtain 
                  wall studs supporting heavyweight exterior walls in high seismic areas.

              A3.3 Yield Stress and Strength Increase From Cold Work of Forming 

                A3.3.1 Yield Stress 

                   The strength of cold-formed steel structural members depends on the yield stress, except in 
                those cases where elastic local buckling or overall buckling is critical. Because the stress-strain 
                curve of steel sheet or strip can be either the sharp-yielding type (Figure C-A3.3.1-1(a)) or 
                gradual-yielding type (Figure C-A3.3.1-1(b)), the method for determining the yield point for 
                sharp-yielding steel and the yield strength for gradual-yielding steel are based on ASTM 
                Standard A370 (ASTM, 2015). As shown in Figure C-A3.3.1-2(a), the yield point for sharp-
                yielding steel is defined by the stress level of the plateau. For gradual-yielding steel, the 
                stress-strain curve is rounded out at the “knee” and the yield strength is determined by 
                either the offset method (Figure C-A3.3.1-2(b)) or the extension under the load method 
                (Figure C-A3.3.1-2(c)). The term yield stress used in the Specification applies to either yield 
                point or yield strength. Section 1.2 of the AISI Design Manual (AISI, 2013) lists the minimum 
                mechanical properties specified by the ASTM specifications for various steels.

                                    (a) Sharp Yielding, (b) Gradual Yielding 

                   The strength of members that are governed by buckling depends not only on the yield 
                stress but also on the modulus of elasticity of steel, E, and the tangent modulus of steel, E t . 
                The modulus of elasticity is defined by the slope of the initial straight portion of the stress-
                strain curve (Figure C-A3.3.1-1). The measured values of E on the basis of the standard 
                methods usually range from 29,000 to 30,000 ksi (200 to 207 GPa or 2.0x10 6  to 2.1x10 6  
                kg/cm 2 ). A value of 29,500 ksi (203 GPa or 2.07x10 6  kg/cm 2 ) is used in the Specification for 
                design purposes. The tangent modulus is defined by the slope of the stress-strain curve at

                any stress level, as shown in Figure C-A3.3.1-1(b). 
                   For sharp-yielding steels, E t  = E up to the yield point, but with gradual-yielding steels, 
                Et  = E only up to the proportional limit, f pr . Once the stress exceeds the proportional limit, 
                the tangent modulus, E t , becomes progressively smaller than the initial modulus of 
                elasticity.  
                   Various buckling provisions of the Specification have been written for gradual-yielding 
                steels whose proportional limit is not lower than about 70 percent of the specified minimum 
                yield stress. 
                   Determination of proportional limits for informational purposes can be done simply by 
                using the offset method shown in Figure C-A3.3.1-2(b) with the distance “om” equal to 
                0.0001 length/length (0.01 percent offset) and calling the stress R where “mn” intersects the 
                stress-strain curve at “r”, the proportional limit.

                A3.3.2 Strength Increase From Cold Work of Forming 

                   The mechanical properties of the flat steel sheet, strip, plate or bar, such as yield stress, 
                tensile strength, and elongation may be substantially different from the properties exhibited 
                by the cold-formed steel sections. Figure C-A3.3.2-1 illustrates the increase of yield stress 
                and tensile strength from those of the virgin material at the section locations in a cold-
                formed steel channel section and a joist chord (Karren and Winter, 1967). This difference 
                can be attributed to cold working of the material during the cold-forming process. 
                   The influence of cold work on mechanical properties was investigated by Chajes, 
                Britvec, Winter, Karren, and Uribe at Cornell University in the 1960s (Chajes, Britvec, and 
                Winter, 1963; Karren, 1967; Karren and Winter, 1967; Winter and Uribe, 1968). It was found

                that the changes of mechanical properties due to cold-stretching are caused mainly by 
                strain-hardening and strain-aging, as illustrated in Figure C-A3.3.2-2 (Chajes, Britvec, and 
                Winter, 1963). In this figure, Curve A represents the stress-strain curve of the virgin 
                material. Curve B is due to unloading in the strain-hardening range, Curve C represents 
                immediate reloading, and Curve D is the stress-strain curve of reloading after strain-aging. 
                It is interesting to note that the yield stresses of both Curves C and D are higher than the 
                yield point of the virgin material and that the ductilities decrease after strain hardening and 
                strain aging. 
                   Cornell research also revealed that the effects of cold work on the mechanical 
                properties of corners usually depend on: (1) the type of steel, (2) the type of stress

                (compression or tension), (3) the direction of stress with respect to the direction of cold 
                work (transverse or longitudinal), (4) the F u /F y  ratio, (5) the inside radius-to-thickness ratio 
                (R/t), and (6) the amount of cold work. Among the above items, the F u /F y  and R/t ratios 
                are the most important factors to affect the change in mechanical properties of formed 
                sections. Virgin material with a large F u /F y  ratio possesses a large potential for strain 
                hardening. Consequently, as the F u /F y  ratio increases, the effect of cold work on the 
                increase in the yield stress of steel increases. Small inside radius-to-thickness ratios, R/t, 
                correspond to a large degree of cold work in a corner and therefore, for a given material, 
                the smaller the R/t ratio, the larger the increase in yield stress. 
                   Investigating the influence of cold work, Karren derived the following equations for 
                the ratio of corner yield stress-to-virgin yield stress (Karren, 1967): 
                   F      B    yc =    c                                                   (C-A3.3.2-1)  F         myv      )t/R(

                    t   = Sheet thickness 
                   With regard to the full-section properties, the tensile yield stress of the full section may 
                be approximated by using a weighted average as follows: 
                  Fya  = CF yc  + (1 - C)F yf                                             (C-A3.3.2-2) 
                    where 
                    Fya  = Full-section tensile yield stress

                    C  = Ratio of corner area to total cross-sectional area. For flexural members having 
                         unequal flanges, the one giving a smaller C value is considered to be the

                   Good agreements between the computed and the tested stress-strain characteristics for 
                a channel section and a joist chord section were demonstrated by Karren and Winter 
                (Karren and Winter, 1967). 
                   The limitation F ya  ≤ F uv  places an upper bound on the average yield stress. The intent of 
                the upper bound is to limit stresses in flat elements that may not see significant increases in 
                yield stress and tensile strength as compared to the virgin steel properties.

                                           Stress-Strain Characteristics 
                           In the last three decades, additional studies have been made by numerous 
                investigators. These investigations dealt with the cold-formed sections having large R/t 
                ratios and thick materials. They also considered residual stress distribution, simplification 
                of design methods, and other related subjects. For details, see Yu and LaBoube (2010). 
                   In 1962, the Specification permitted the utilization of cold work of forming on the basis 
                of full section tests. Since 1968, the Specification has allowed the use of the increased 
                average yield stress of the section, F ya , to be determined by: (1) full section tensile tests,  
                (2) stub column tests, or (3) computed in accordance with Equation C-A3.3.2-2. However, 
                such a strength increase is limited only to relatively compact sections designed according 
                to Specification Chapter D (tension members), Chapter F (bending strength excluding the 
                use of inelastic reserve capacity), Chapter E (concentrically loaded compression members), 
                Section H1 (combined axial load and bending), Section I4 (cold-formed steel light-frame 
                construction), and Sections I6.1 and I6.2 (purlins, girts and other members). A design 
                example in the Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013) demonstrates the use of 
                strength increase from cold work of forming for a channel section to be used as a beam. 
                   Prior to 2016, the requirements for applying the provisions of strength increase from 
                cold work of forming were written for using the Effective Width Method. The requirements 
                were revised in 2016 to make the provisions also applicable to the Direct Strength Method. 
                The strength increase from cold work of forming is applicable to sections that are not 
                subject to strength reduction from local and distortional buckling at a stress level of F y  for 
                compression members or when the extreme compression fiber reaches F y  for flexural 
                members. In some cases, when evaluating the effective width of the web using the Effective 
                Width Method, the reduction factor ρ according to Specification Section 1.1.2 may be less than 
                unity but the sum of b 1  and b 2  of Figure 1.1.2-1 of the Specification may be such that the web 
                is fully effective, and cold work of forming may be used. This situation only arises when 
                the web width to flange width ratio, h o /b o , is less than or equal to 4. 
                   In the development of the AISI LRFD Specification, the following statistical data on 
                material and cross-sectional properties were developed by Rang, Galambos and Yu (1979a 
                and 1979b) for use in the derivation of resistance factors φ:

            B. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 
             
            B1 General Provisions 

               This Specification provides design provisions for cold-formed steel members and structural 
            assemblies. Specification Section B1 provides the essential design requirements: the design of 
            members and their connections should be consistent with the intended use of the structure and 
            the assumptions made in the analysis of the structure. 
             
            B2 Loads and Load Combinations 

               Loads and load combinations should be determined in accordance with applicable building code. 
            In the absence of an applicable building code, ASCE/SEI 7, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and 
            Other Structures, should be followed in the United States and Mexico, and the National Building 
            Code of Canada (NBCC) should be followed in Canada. 
               When steel decks are used for roof and floor composite construction, they should be 
            designed to carry the concrete dead load, the steel dead load, and the construction live load. 
            When the ASD or LRFD method is used, the construction loads and load combinations should be 
            based on the sequential loading of concrete as specified in ANSI/SDI C-2011 (SDI, 2011) or in 
            ANSI/SDI NC-2010 (SDI, 2010). 
               These loads and load combinations with proper care during construction provide safe 
            construction practices for cold-formed steel decks and panels which otherwise may be 
            damaged.  
               When the LSD method is used, the NBCC should be followed. 

            B3 Design Basis 

               As stated in Specification Section B3, design should be based on the principle that no 
            applicable strength or serviceability limit state is exceeded when the structure is subjected to 
            load effects corresponding to the applicable load combinations. 
               A limit state is the condition at which the structural usefulness of a load-carrying element or 
            member is impaired to such an extent that it becomes unsafe for the occupants of the structure, 
            or the element no longer performs its intended function. Typical limit states for cold-formed 
            steel members are excessive deflection, yielding, buckling and attainment of maximum strength 
            after local buckling (i.e., post-buckling strength). These limit states have been established through 
            experience in practice or in the laboratory, and they have been thoroughly investigated through 
            analytical and experimental research. The background for the establishment of the limit states is 
            extensively documented (Winter, 1970; Peköz, 1986b; and Yu and LaBoube, 2010), and a 
            continuing research effort provides further improvement in understanding them. 
               Three design methods are provided in the Specification for strength: Allowable Strength Design 
            (ASD), Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), and Limit States Design (LSD). Both Allowable 
            Strength Design (ASD) and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) are applicable only in the 
            United States and Mexico, while the Limit States Design (LSD) is applicable in Canada. ASD and 
            LRFD are distinct methods. They are not identical and not interchangeable. Indiscriminate use 
            of combinations of the ASD and LRFD methods could result in unpredictable performance or 
            unsafe design. There are, however, circumstances in which the two methods could be used in 
            the design, modification or renovation of a structural system without conflict, such as providing

            modifications to a structural floor system of an older building after assessing the as-built 
            conditions. 
               In the ASD, LRFD and LSD methods, two types of limit states are considered. They are: (1) 
            the limit state of the strength required to resist the extreme loads during the intended life of the 
            structure, and (2) the limit state of the ability of the structure to perform its intended function 
            during its life. These two limit states are usually referred to as the limit state of strength and limit 
            state of serviceability. The ASD, LRFD and LSD methods focus on the limit state of strength in 
            Specification Sections B3.2.1, B3.2.2, and B3.2.3, respectively; and the limit state of serviceability in 
            Specification Section B3.7. 
             
              B3.1 Required Strength [Effect Due to Factored Loads] 

                 Generally, design is performed by elastic analysis. The required strength [effect due to 
              factored loads] is determined by the appropriate methods of structural analysis. In some 
              circumstances, as in the proportioning of stability bracing members that carry no calculated 
              forces, the required strength [effect due to factored loads] is explicitly stated in the Specification.  
             
              B3.2 Design for Strength 

                 The Allowable Strength Design method has been featured in AISI Specifications beginning 
              with the 1946 edition. It is included in the Specification along with the LRFD and the LSD 
              methods for use in the United States, Mexico, and Canada since the 2001 edition. 
             
                B3.2.1 Allowable Strength Design (ASD) Requirements 

                   In the Allowable Strength Design approach, the required strengths (bending moments, 
                axial forces, and shear forces) in structural members are computed by accepted methods of 
                structural analysis for the specified nominal or working loads for all applicable load 
                combinations determined according to Specification Section B2. These required strengths are 
                not to exceed the allowable strengths permitted by the Specification. According to Specification 
                Section B3.2.1, the allowable strength is determined by dividing the nominal strength by a 
                safety factor as follows: 
                  R ≤ R n /Ω                                                        (C-B3.2.1-1) 
                    where 
                    R = Required strength 
                    Rn  = Nominal strength 
                    Ω = Safety factor 
                   The fundamental nature of the safety factor is to compensate for uncertainties inherent 
                in the design, fabrication, or erection of building components, as well as uncertainties in 
                the estimation of applied loads. Appropriate safety factors are explicitly specified in various 
                sections of the Specification. Through experience, it has been established that the present 
                safety factors provide satisfactory design. It should be noted that the ASD method employs 
                only one safety factor for a given condition regardless of the type of load. Serviceability is 
                addressed in Specification Section B3.7. 
             
                B3.2.2 Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Requirements 

                   For the limit state of strength, the general format of the LRFD method is expressed by 
                the following equation:

                  or  
                  Ru  ≤ φRn  
                    where 
                    Ru  = Σγ i Qi  = Required strength 
                    Rn  = Nominal resistance 
                    φ   = Resistance factor 
                    γi   = Load factors 
                    Qi  = Load effects 
                    φRn  = Design strength 
                   The nominal resistance is the strength of the element or member for a given limit state, 
                computed for nominal section properties and for minimum specified material properties 
                according to the appropriate analytical model which defines the strength. The resistance 
                factor, φ, accounts for the uncertainties and variabilities inherent in the R n , and it is usually 
                less than unity. The load effects, Q i , are the forces on the cross-section (i.e., bending moment, 
                axial force, or shear force) determined from the specified nominal loads by structural analysis 
                and γi  are the corresponding load factors, which account for the uncertainties and 
                variabilities of the loads.  
                   The advantages of LRFD are: (1) the uncertainties and the variabilities of different types 
                of loads and resistances are different (e.g., dead load is less variable than wind load), and so 
                these differences can be accounted for by use of multiple factors, and (2) by using 
                probability theory, designs can ideally achieve a more consistent reliability. Thus, LRFD 
                provides the basis for a more rational and refined design method than is possible with the 
                ASD method. 
                (a) Probabilistic Concepts 
                   Safety factors or load factors are provided against the uncertainties and variabilities 
                which are inherent in the design process. Structural design consists of comparing nominal 
                load effects Q to nominal resistances R, but both Q and R are random parameters (see Figure 
                C-B3.2.2-1). A limit state is violated if R<Q. While the possibility of this event ever 
                occurring is never zero, a successful design should, nevertheless, have only an acceptably 
                small probability of exceeding the limit state. If the exact probability distributions of Q and 
                R were known, then the probability of (R - Q) < 0 could be exactly determined for any 
                design. In general, the distributions of Q and R are not known, and only the means, Q m  
                and R m , and the standard deviations, σQ  and σR , are available. Nevertheless, it is possible 
                to determine relative reliabilities of several designs by the scheme illustrated in Figure C-
                B3.2.2-2. The distribution curve shown is for ln(R/Q), and a limit state is exceeded when 
                ln(R/Q) ≤ 0. The area under ln(R/Q) ≤ 0 is the probability of violating the limit state. The 
                size of this area is dependent on the distance between the origin and the mean of ln(R/Q). 
                For given statistical data R m , Q m , σR  and σQ , the area under ln(R/Q) ≤ 0 can be varied by 
                changing the value of β (Figure C-B3.2.2-2), since βσ ln(R/Q)  = ln(R/Q) m , from which 
                approximately

                The index, β, is called the “reliability index,” and it is a relative measure of the safety of the 
                design. When two designs are compared, the one with the larger β is more reliable.

                   The concept of the reliability index can be used for determining the relative reliability 
                inherent in current design, and it can be used in testing out the reliability of new design 
                formats, as illustrated by the following example of a simply supported beam, braced 
                against distortional buckling and lateral-torsional buckling, subjected to dead and live loading 
                and designed considering local buckling using the Effective Width Method.

                    s  = Beam spacing 
                    D and L are, respectively, the code-specified dead and live load intensities. 
                The mean resistance is defined as (Ravindra and Galambos, 1978): 
                  Rm  = R n (P m Mm Fm )                                               (C-B3.2.2-4) 
                In the above equation, R n  is the nominal resistance, which in this case is  
                  Rn  = S e Fy                                                        (C-B3.2.2-5) 
               that is, the nominal moment predicted on the basis of the post-buckling strength of the 
                compression flange and the web using the Effective Width Method. The mean values P m , M m , 
                and F m , and the corresponding coefficients of variation V P , V M , and V F , are the statistical 
                parameters, which define the variability of the resistance: 
                    Pm   = Mean ratio of the experimentally determined moment to the predicted 
                          moment for the actual material and cross-sectional properties of the test 
                          specimens 
                    Mm  = Mean ratio of the actual yield stress to the minimum specified value 
                    Fm   = Mean ratio of the actual section modulus to the specified (nominal) value 
                    The coefficient of variation of R equals 
                                     VVVV      2     2    2PR             ++=        M    F                                         (C-B3.2.2-6) 
                   The values of these data were obtained from examining available tests prior to 1990 on 
                beams having different compression flanges with partially and fully effective flanges and 
                webs, and from analyzing data on yield stress values from tests and cross-sectional 
                dimensions from many measurements. This information was developed from research 
                (Hsiao, Yu, and Galambos, 1988a and 1990; Hsiao, 1989) and is given below: 
             P m  = 1.11, V P  = 0.09; M m  = 1.10, V M  = 0.10; F m  = 1.0, V F  = 0.05 and thus  
              R m  = 1.22R n  and V R  = 0.14. 
                The mean load effect is equal to 
                  Qm   =       8/sL(  2s    )(       )LD    mm +                                            (C-B3.2.2-7)

               where D m  and L m  are the mean dead and live load intensities, respectively, and V D  and V L  
                are the corresponding coefficients of variation.  
                   Load statistics have been analyzed in a study of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) 
                (Ellingwood et al., 1980), where it was shown that D m  = 1.05D, V D  = 0.1; L m  = L, V L  = 0.25. 
                   The mean live load intensity equals the code live load intensity if the tributary area is 
                small enough so that no live load reduction is included. Substitution of the load statistics 
                into Equations C-B3.2.2-7 and C-B3.2.2-8 gives: 
                          sL 2     D05.1 Qm = s  (     + L)1                                            (C-B3.2.2-9) 8    L

                   Qm  and V Q  thus depend on the dead-to-live load ratio. Cold-formed steel beams 
                typically have small D/L ratios, which may vary for different applications. Different D/L 
                ratio may be assumed by different countries for developing design criteria. The impact of 
                D/L ratio on the reliability is also provided in Meimand and Schafer (2014). For the 
                purposes of checking the reliability of these LRFD criteria, it has been assumed that D/L = 
                1/5, and so Q m  = 1.21L(L s2  s/8) and V Q  = 0.21. 
                   From Equations C-B3.2.2-3 and C-B3.2.2-5, the nominal resistance, R n , can be obtained 
                for D/L = 1/5 and Ω = 1.67 as follows: 
                  R = 2L      )8/sL(  2n      s     
                   In order to determine the reliability index, β, from Equation C-B3.2.2-2, the R m /Q m  
                ratio is required by considering R m  = 1.22R n :

                Therefore, from Equation C-B3.2.2-2, 
                        ln(2.02)=β               2.79=

                   Of itself, β= 2.79 for beams having different compression flanges with partially and fully 
                effective flanges and webs designed by the Specification means nothing. However, when this 
                is compared to β for other types of cold-formed steel members, and to β for designs of 
                various types from hot-rolled steel shapes or even for other materials, then it is possible to 
                say that this particular cold-formed steel beam has about an average reliability (Galambos 
                et al., 1982). 
                (b) Basis for LRFD of Cold-Formed Steel Structures 
                   A great deal of work has been performed for determining the values of the reliability 
                index, β, inherent in traditional design as exemplified by the current structural design 
                specifications such as the ANSI/AISC 360 for hot-rolled steel, the AISI Specification for 
                cold-formed steel, the ACI 318 Code for reinforced concrete members, etc. The studies for 
                hot-rolled steel are summarized by Ravindra and Galambos (1978), where many other 
                papers are also referenced which contain additional data. The determination of β for cold-
                formed steel elements or members is presented in several research reports of the 
                University of Missouri-Rolla (Hsiao, Yu, and Galambos, 1988a; Rang, Galambos, and Yu, 
                1979a, 1979b, 1979c, and 1979d; Supornsilaphachai, Galambos, and Yu, 1979), where both 
                the basic research data as well as the β’s inherent in the Specification are presented in great 
                detail. The β’s computed in the above-referenced publications were developed with 
                slightly different load statistics than those of this Commentary, but the essential conclusions 
                remain the same. 
                   The entire set of data for hot-rolled steel and cold-formed steel designs, as well as data 
                for reinforced concrete, aluminum, laminated timber, and masonry walls, was reanalyzed 
                by Ellingwood, Galambos, MacGregor, and Cornell (Ellingwood et al., 1980; Galambos et 
                al., 1982; Ellingwood et al., 1982) using (a) updated load statistics and (b) a more advanced

                level of probability analysis which was able to incorporate probability distributions and to 
                describe the true distributions more realistically. The details of this extensive reanalysis are 
                presented by the investigators. Only the final conclusions from the analysis are 
                summarized below.  
                   The values of the reliability index, β, vary considerably for the different kinds of 
                loading, the different types of construction, and the different types of members within a 
                given material design specification. In order to achieve more consistent reliability, it was 
                suggested by Ellingwood, et al. (1982) that the following values of β would provide this 
                improved consistency while at the same time give, on the average, essentially the same 
                design by the LRFD method as is obtained by prior designs for all materials of 
                construction. Ellingwood’s recommended target reliability indices, βo , were for  members 
                with gravity loading: βo  = 3.0,  for connections with gravity loading: βo  = 4.5,  and for wind 
                loading: βo  = 2.5. These target reliability indices are the ones inherent in the load factors first 
                recommended in the ASCE 7-98 Load Standard (ASCE, 1998). 
                   For simply supported, braced cold-formed steel beams with stiffened flanges, which 
                were designed according to the Allowable Strength Design method in the current 
                Specification or to any previous version of the Specification, it was shown that for the 
                representative dead-to-live load ratio of 1/5, the reliability index β = 2.79. Considering the 
                fact that for other such load ratios, or for other types of members, the reliability index 
                inherent in current cold-formed steel construction could be more or less than this value of 
                2.79, a somewhat lower target reliability index of βo  = 2.5 is recommended as a lower limit 
                in the United States for members with gravity loads. 
                   The resistance factors, φ, were selected such that βo  = 2.5 is essentially the lower bound 
                of the actual β’s for members supporting gravity loads. In order to ensure that failure of a 
                structure is not initiated in the connections, a higher target reliability of βo  = 3.5 is 
                recommended for joints and fasteners in the United States. These two targets of 2.5 and 3.5 
                for members and connections, respectively, are somewhat lower than those recommended 
                by the ASCE 7-98 (i.e., 3.0 and 4.5, respectively), but they are essentially the same targets as 
                the basis for the AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 1999).  
                   For wind loading, the same ASCE target reliability index of βo  = 2.5 is used for 
                connections in the U.S. LRFD method. For flexural members such as individual purlins, girts, 
                panels, and roof decks subjected to the combination of dead and wind loads, the target 
                reliability index, βo , used in the United States is reduced to 1.5. With this reduced target 
                reliability index, the design based on the U.S. LRFD method is comparable to the U.S. 
                Allowable Strength Design method. 
                (c) Resistance Factors 
                   The following portions of this Commentary present the background for the resistance 
                factors, φ, which are recommended for various members and connections in Chapters D 
                through J. These φ factors are determined in conformance with the ASCE/SEI 7 load factors 
                to provide approximately a target reliability index βo  of 2.5 for members and 3.5 for 
                connections, respectively, for a typical load combination 1.2D+1.6L. For practical reasons, it 
                is desirable to have relatively few different resistance factors, and so the actual values of β 
                will differ from the derived targets. This means that: 
                  φRn  = c(1.2D+1.6L) = (1.2D/L+1.6)cL                               (C-B3.2.2-11)

               where c is the deterministic influence coefficient translating load intensities to load effects. 
                   By assuming D/L = 1/5, Equations C-B3.2.2-11 and C-B3.2.2-9 can be rewritten as 
                follows: 
                  Rn   = 1.84(cL/φ)                                               (C-B3.2.2-12) 
                  Qm   = (1.05D/L+1)cL = 1.21cL                                     (C-B3.2.2-13) 
                Therefore, 
                  Rm /Q m  =(1.521/φ)(R m /R n )                                       (C-B3.2.2-14) 
                   The φ factor can be computed from Equation C-B3.2.2-15 on the basis of Equations C-
                B3.2.2-2, C-B3.2.2-4 and C-B3.2.2-14 (Hsiao, Yu and Galambos, 1988b, AISI 1996): 

                  φ  = 1.521 (P m Mm Fm )exp(-β    2    2 o  R   VV  + Q )                           (C-B3.2.2-15) 
               in which βo  is the target reliability index. Other symbols were defined previously. For other 
                load combinations and load ratios, corrected values for the 1.521 pre-factor (known as C φ ) 
                and V Q  are provided in Meimand and Schafer (2014).  
                   By knowing the φ factor, the corresponding safety factor, Ω, for Allowable Strength Design 
                can be computed for the load combination 1.2D+1.6L as follows:  
                  Ω = (1.2D/L + 1.6)/[φ(D/L + 1)]                                   (C-B3.2.2-16) 
                where D/L is the dead-to-live load ratio for the given condition. 
             
                B3.2.3 Limit States Design (LSD) Requirements 

                   In Limit States Design, the resistance of a structural component is checked against the 
                various limit states. For the ultimate limit states resistance, the structural member must 
                retain its load-carrying capacity up to the factored load levels. For serviceability limit states, the 
                performance of the structure must be satisfactory at specified load levels. Specified loads are 
                those prescribed by the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC). Examples of serviceability 
                requirements include deflections and the possibility of vibrations. 
                   For the limit state of strength, the general format of the LSD method is expressed by the 
                following equation: 
                  φRn   ≥ Σγ i Qi                                                      (C-B3.2.3-1) 
                or  
                  φRn  ≥ Rf   
                    where 
                    Rf   = Σγ i Qi  = Effect of factored loads 
                    Rn  = Nominal resistance 
                    φ   = Resistance factor 
                    γi   = Load factors 
                    Qi   = Load effects 
                    φRn  = Factored resistance 
                   The nominal resistance is the strength of the element or member for a given limit state, 
                computed for nominal section properties and for minimum specified material properties 
                according to the appropriate analytical model which defines the resistance. The factored 
                resistance is given by the product φRn , where φ is the resistance factor which is applied to the 
                nominal member resistance, R n . The resistance factor is intended to take into account the fact

                that the resistance of the member may be less than anticipated, due to variability of the 
                material properties, dimensions, and workmanship, as well as the type of failure and 
                uncertainty in the prediction of the resistance. The resistance factor does not, however, cover 
                gross human errors. Human errors cause most structural failures and typically these 
                human errors are “gross” errors. Gross errors are completely unpredictable and are not 
                covered by the overall safety factor inherent in buildings.  
                   The NBCC defines a set of load factors, load combination factors, and specified minimum 
                loads to be used in the design, hence fixing the position of the nominal load distribution and 
                the factored load distribution. The design standard is then obligated to specify the 
                appropriate resistance function. 
                   The load effects, Q i , are the forces on the cross-section (i.e., bending moment, axial force, 
                or shear force) determined from the specified nominal loads by structural analysis, and γi  are 
                the corresponding load factors, which account for the uncertainties and variabilities of the 
                loads. 
                   In Limit States Design, structural reliability is specified in terms of a safety index, β, 
                determined through a statistical analysis of the loads and resistances. The safety index is 
                directly related to the structural reliability of the design; hence, increasing β increases the 
                reliability, and decreasing β decreases the reliability. The safety index, β, is also directly 
                related to the load and resistance factors used in the design. 
                   Those responsible for writing a design standard are given the load distribution and load 
                factors, and must calibrate the resistance factors, φ, such that the safety index, β, reaches a 
                certain target value. The technical committee responsible for CSA Group Standard S136 
                elected to use a target safety index of 3.0 for members and 4.0 for connections.  
                   In order to determine the loading for calibration, it was assumed that 80 percent of 
                cold-formed steel is used in panel form (e.g., roof or floor deck, wall panels, etc.) and the 
                remaining 20 percent for structural sections (purlins, girts, studs, etc.). An effective load 
                factor was arrived at by assuming live-to-dead load ratios and their relative frequencies of 
                occurrence.  
                   Probabilistic studies show that consistent probabilities of failure are determined for all 
                live-to-dead load ratios when a live load factor of 1.50 and a dead load factor of 1.25 are used. 
                   Since the design basis for the LSD and the LRFD is the same, further discussions on 
                how to obtain a resistance factor using probability analysis can be obtained from Section 
                B3.2.2(c) of the Commentary. However, attention should be paid to the fact that target 
                values for members and connections as well as the dead-to-live load ratio may vary from 
                country to country. These variations lead to differences in resistance factors. The dead-to-
                live load ratio used in Canada is assumed to be 1:3 (or 1/3), and the target of the reliability 
                index for cold-formed steel structural members is 3.0 for members and 4.0 for connections. 
                These target values are consistent with those used in other CSA Group design standards. 
             
              B3.3 Design of Structural Members 

                 For the design of cold-formed steel axial or flexural members, consideration should be 
              given to several design features: (a) axial or bending strength and combined axial and 
              bending, (b) shear strength of webs and combined bending and shear, (c) web crippling 
              strength and combined bending and web crippling, (d) bracing requirements, and (e) 
              serviceability. For some cases, special consideration should also be given to shear lag and

              flange curling due to the use of thin material. The design provisions for items (a), (b) and (c) 
              are provided in Specification Chapters D, E, F, G and H, and Sections I6.1, I6.2, and I6.3; while 
              Item (d), the requirements for lateral and stability bracing, is given in Specification Sections C2 
              and I6.4; and Item (e) is covered in Chapter L. The treatments for flange curling and shear lag 
              are discussed in Sections L3 and B4.3 of the Commentary, respectively. 
                 Rational engineering analysis, such as the Direct Strength Method, is permitted to be used if 
              the section geometry or material properties are outside the limitations given in Specification 
              Section B4.   
                 Example problems are given in Parts II and III of the AISI Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual 
              (AISI, 2013) for the design of flexural and axial members. 
             
              B3.4 Design of Connections 

                 Specification Section B3.4 provides the charging language for Chapter J on the design of 
              connections. Chapter J covers the proportioning of the individual elements of a connection 
              (welds, bolts, screws, and power-actuated fasteners, etc.) once the load effects on the connection 
              are known. Section B3.4 establishes that the modeling assumptions associated with the 
              structural analysis must be consistent with the conditions used in Chapter J to proportion the 
              connecting elements. 
             
              B3.5 Design for Stability 

                 Design for stability needs to consider the stability of the structural system and also the 
              stability of its individual members. Design provisions are provided in Specification Chapter C. 
             
              B3.6 Design of Structural Assemblies and Systems 

                 Specification Section B3.6 provides charging language on the design of cold-formed steel 
              assemblies and systems included in Specification Chapter I. Chapter I provides design 
              provisions for cold-formed steel built-up members and metal roof and wall systems; and 
              references design standards for diaphragm, light-frame construction, and rack systems.  
             
              B3.7 Design for Serviceability 

                 Serviceability limit states are conditions under which a structure can no longer perform its 
              intended functions. Safety and strength considerations are generally not affected by 
              serviceability limit states. However, serviceability criteria are essential to ensure functional 
              performance and economy of design. 
                 Common conditions which may require serviceability limits are: 
              (a) Excessive deflections or rotations which may affect the appearance or functional use of 
                 the structure. Deflections which may cause damage to non-structural elements should be 
                 considered. 
              (b) Excessive vibrations which may cause occupant discomfort or equipment malfunctions. 
              (c) Deterioration over time, which may include corrosion or appearance considerations. 
                 When checking serviceability, the designer should consider appropriate service loads, the 
              response of the structure, and the reaction of building occupants. 
                 Service loads that may require consideration include static loads, snow or rain loads, 
              temperature fluctuations, and dynamic loads from human activities, wind-induced effects, or 
              the operation of equipment. The service loads are actual loads that act on the structure at an

              arbitrary point in time. Appropriate service loads for checking serviceability limit states may 
              only be a fraction of the nominal loads. 
                 The response of the structure to service loads can normally be analyzed assuming linear 
              elastic behavior. However, members that accumulate residual deformations under service 
              loads may require consideration of this long-term behavior. 
                 Serviceability limits depend on the function of the structure and on the perceptions of the 
              observer. In contrast to the strength limit states, it is not possible to specify general 
              serviceability limits that are applicable to all structures. The Specification does not contain 
              explicit requirements; however, guidance is generally provided by the applicable building code. 
              In the absence of specific criteria, guidelines may be found in Fisher and West (1990), 
              Ellingwood (1989), Murray (1991), AISC (2010a) and ATC (1999). 
             
              B3.8 Design for Ponding 

                 Ponding refers to the retention of water due solely to the deflection of flat roof framing. 
              The amount of accumulated water is dependent on the stiffness of the framing. Unbounded 
              incremental deflections due to the incremental increase in retained water can result in the 
              collapse of the roof. The problem becomes catastrophic when more water causes more 
              deflection, resulting in more room for more water until the roof collapses.  
                 The Specification requires that design for ponding be considered if water is impounded on 
              the roof. Camber and deflections due to loads acting concurrently with rain or snow 
              meltwater loads can be considered in establishing the initial conditions.    
                 Determination of ponding stability is typically done by structural analysis where the rain 
              loads are increased commensurate with incremental deflections of the framing system under 
              the accumulated rainwater assuming the primary roof drains are blocked. 
                 ANSI/AISC 360 Appendix 2 (AISC, 2010) can be used for considering ponding stability, 
              except the effective section properties as defined in the Specification should be used. The 
              effective section properties should be calculated based on the load cases and combinations 
              consistent with the requirements of ANSI/AISC 360 Appendix 2 for checking the ponding 
              stability and the specific circumstances of the roof configuration considered.  
                 For Canada, Commentary H of the User's Guide - NBC 2010, Structural Commentary (Part 4 
              of Division B)   (NBC, 2010) can be used to determine the stiffness when ponding instability will 
              occur. When calculating the stiffness, the effective section properties as defined in the 
              Specification must be used.  
             
              B3.9 Design for Fatigue 

                 Section B3.9 provides the charging language for Chapter M on the design of fatigue for 
              cold-formed steel structural members and connections. Fatigue may occur when the structure is 
              subjected to cyclic or repetitive load, which results in repetitive tensile stresses in the 
              connections and the members. Fatigue, however, does not need to be considered for seismic 
              load or wind load due to either infrequent load cycle or infrequent high load magnitude that 
              would cause fatigue. 
             
              B3.10  Design for Corrosion Effects 

                 Steel members may deteriorate in some service environments. This deterioration may 
              appear either as external corrosion, which would be visible upon inspection, or as undetected

              changes that would reduce member strength. The designer should recognize these problems 
              by either factoring a specific amount of tolerance for damage into the design, or providing 
              adequate protection (for example, coatings or cathodic protection) or planned maintenance 
              programs or both so that such problems do not occur. 
             
            B4 Dimensional Limits and Considerations 

               The Specification permits two methods for the basic design of members in Chapters E 
            through H, including the Effective Width Method and the Direct Strength Method. The Specification 
            indicates no preference between the two methods as either provides consistent levels of 
            reliability even though they may not result in numerically equal answers. 
             
              B4.1 Limitations for Use of the Effective Width Method or Direct Strength Method 

                 In 2016, the applicability limitations of the Effective Width Method and the Direct Strength 
              Method were merged into this section and simplified. To some extent, these limitations are 
              arbitrary; however, the provided limitations give practical limits on the applicability of the 
              design methods and reflect serviceability limitations, limitations borne from practice, and in 
              some cases limitations of available testing or other verification methods. 
                 The Effective Width Method limitations originate with the work of Winter (1970). The limits 
              for stiffened elements in bending were updated in 1980 based on the studies conducted at the 
              University of Missouri-Rolla in the 1970s (LaBoube and Yu, 1978a, 1978b, and 1982b; 
              Hetrakul and Yu, 1978 and 1980; Nguyen and Yu, 1978a and 1978b) and aligned with the 
              AISC Specification (AISC, 1989) at that time. 
                 The effective width provisions of Appendix 1 provide no reductions for corners. For inside 
              bend radius-to-thickness ratios (R/t) in excess of 10, this is shown to be unconservative based 
              on the studies of Sarawit (2003), and Zeinoddini and Schafer (2010). For members with large 
              radius-to-thickness, the Direct Strength Method may be employed, which is applicable for 
              radius-to-thickness ratios R/t less than 20. Alternatively, the Specification specifically allows 
              for rational engineering analysis. Using an equivalent centerline model to determine the effective 
              width of the flats or appropriately reducing the plate buckling coefficient are examples of such 
              rational engineering analyses.  
                 In Zeinoddini and Schafer (2010), the following method is shown to provide a rational 
              reduction for 10 < R/t ≤ 20. A reduced plate buckling coefficient, k R , is determined by 
              applying reduction factors based on the R/t value at each edge of the element. For 
              unstiffened elements, only one reduction factor is applied. The plate buckling coefficient, k R , 
              which replaces k in Appendix 1, is determined as follows: 
                kR   = k R R1  R R2                                                      (C-B4.1-1) 
                  where 
                  k   = Plate buckling coefficient determined in accordance with Specification Appendix 1, 
                        as applicable 
                  RR1   = 1.08 – (R 1 /t)/50 ≤ 1.0                                         (C-B4.1-2) 
                  RR2   = 1.08 – (R 2 /t)/50 ≤ 1.0                                         (C-B4.1-3) 
                    where 
                    R1 , R 2  = Inside bend radius. See Figure C-B4.1-1 
                    t     = Thickness of element. See Figure C-B4.1-1 
                   Engineers are reminded that when rational engineering analysis methods are employed,

                   Prior to 2016, the Specification provided detailed dimensional limits for all cross-
                sections using the Direct Strength Method (DSM). This approach was simplified and made 
                parallel to the Effective Width Method limitations in 2016. The limits employed in Table B4.1-
                1 are based on the limits of available testing and judgment. The reliability of the Direct 
                Strength Method within these limitations is detailed in Schafer (2008) and were based on 
                testing of concentrically loaded, pin-ended cold-formed steel columns (Kwon and 
                Hancock, 1992; Lau and Hancock, 1987; Loughlan, 1979; Miller and Peköz, 1994; Mulligan, 
                1983; Polyzois et al., 1993; Thomasson, 1978); laterally braced beams (Cohen, 1987; Ellifritt 
                et al., 1997; LaBoube and Yu, 1978; Moreyara, 1993; Phung and Yu, 1978; Rogers, 1995; 
                Schardt and Schrade, 1982; Schuster, 1992; Shan et al., 1994; Willis and Wallace, 1990) and 
                laterally braced hats and decks (Acharya and Schuster, 1998; Bernard, 1993; Desmond, 
                1977; Höglund, 1980; König, 1978; Papazian et al., 1994). Application to complex lip 
                stiffeners was verified in Schafer, et al. (2006) and application to inside bend radius-to-
                thickness ratio limits up to 20 was verified in Zeinoddini and Schafer (2010). Application of 
                the DSM to sections with multiple stiffeners in the web for bending is given in Pham and 
                Hancock, 2013; with multiple stiffeners in the web for shear in Pham and Hancock, 2012a; 
                and with a single large intermediate stiffener in the web for shear in Pham and Hancock, 
                2015. 
             
              B4.2 Members Falling Outside the Application Limits 

                 In general, members that are outside the applicability limits of Section B4.1 default to the 
              general criteria in Section A1.2; however, the Direct Strength Method provides a general 
              approach to design that is often applicable outside of the provided limits. Recognizing this, 
              the Specification provides specific guidance when the Direct Strength Method is applied outside 
              of Table B4.1-1. For example, companies with proprietary sections may wish to perform their 
              own testing and follow Section K2 of the Specification to justify the use of the Ω and φ factors 
              for a particular cross-section in Specification Chapters D through I. When such testing is 
              performed, the provisions of Specification Sections B4.2 provide some relief from the sample 
              size correction factor, C P , of Specification Section K2. Based on the existing data, the largest 
              observed V P  for the categories within Specification Table B4.1-1 is 15 percent (AISI, 2006; 
              Schafer, 2008). Therefore, as long as the tested section, over at least three tests, exhibits a  
              VP  < 15 percent, then the section is assumed to be similar to the much larger database of 
              tested sections used to calibrate the Direct Strength Method and the correction for small sample 
              sizes is not required, and, therefore, C p  is set to 1.0. If the φ generated from Specification 
              Section K2 is higher than that of Chapters E and F, this is evidence that the section behaves as 
              a section that satisfies Specification Table B4.1-1.

                 It is not anticipated that member testing is necessarily required for all relevant limit 
              states: local, distortional and global buckling. An engineer may only require testing to reflect a 
              single common condition for the member, with a minimum of three tests in that condition. 
              However, beams and columns should be treated as separate entities. A manufacturer who 
              cannot establish a common condition for a product may choose to perform testing in each of 
              the limit states to ensure reliable performance in any condition. Engineering judgment is 
              required. Note that for the purposes of this section, the test results in Specification Section K2 
              are replaced by test-to-predicted ratios. The prediction is that of the Direct Strength Method 
              using the actual material and cross-sectional properties from the tests. The P m  parameter, 
              taken as equal to one in Specification Section K2, is taken instead as the mean of the test-to-
              predicted ratios, and V P  is the accompanying coefficient of variation.  
                 Users of the Direct Strength Method should be aware that beams within the limits of Table 
              B4.1-1 with large flat width-to-thickness ratios in the compression flange will be conservatively 
              predicted by the Direct Strength Method when compared to the Effective Width Method (Schafer 
              and Peköz, 1998). However, the same beam with small longitudinal stiffeners in the 
              compression flange will be well-predicted using the Direct Strength Method. 
                 Alternatively, member geometries that are outside the limits of Specification Table B4.1-1 
              may still use provisions given in Chapters E and F, but with the increased Ω and reduced φ 
              factors consistent with any rational engineering analysis method as prescribed in Section A1.2 
              of the Specification.  
             
              B4.3 Shear Lag Effects — Short Spans Supporting Concentrated Loads 

                 For the beams of usual shapes, the normal stresses are induced in the flanges through shear 
              stresses transferred from the web to the flange. These shear stresses produce shear strains in the 
              flange which, for ordinary dimensions, have negligible effects. However, if flanges are 
              unusually wide (relative to their length), these shear strains have the effect that the normal 
              bending stresses in the flanges decrease with increasing distance from the web. This 
              phenomenon is known as shear lag. It results in a nonuniform stress distribution across the 
              width of the flange, similar to that in stiffened compression elements (see Section 1.1 of the 
              Commentary), though for entirely different reasons. The simplest way of accounting for this 
              stress variation in design is to replace the nonuniformly stressed flange of actual width, w f , by 
              one of reduced, effective width subject to uniform stress (Winter, 1970).

                 Theoretical analyses by various investigators have arrived at results which differ 
              numerically (Roark, 1965). The provisions of Specification Section B4.3 are based on the 
              analysis and supporting experimental evidence obtained by detailed stress measurements on 
              11 beams (Winter, 1940). In fact, the values of effective widths in Specification Table B4.3-1 are 
              taken directly from Curve A of Figure 4 of Winter (1940). 
                 It will be noted that according to Specification Section B4.3, the use of a reduced width for 
              stable, wide flanges is required only for concentrated load as shown in Figure C-B4.3-1. For 
              uniform load, it is seen from Curve B of the figure that the width reduction due to shear lag 
              for any unrealistically large span-width ratios is so small as to be practically negligible. 
                 The phenomenon of shear lag is of considerable consequence in naval architecture and 
              aircraft design. However, in cold-formed steel construction, it is infrequent that beams are so 
              wide as to require significant reductions according to Specification Section B4.3. For design 
              purpose, see the example in the AISI Design Manual (AISI, 2013). 
                 For beams designed by the Direct Strength Method, the shear lag check of Section B4.3 may 
              be reasonably applied by assuming that the member strength (M n /M y ) reduces proportional 
              to the reduced flange effectiveness (b/w). For short spans under concentrated loads, web 
              crippling (not shear lag) is typically the controlling limit state for members with an unstiffened 
              web. 
             
            B5 Member Properties 

               The geometric properties of a member (i.e., area, moment of inertia, section modulus, radius 
            of gyration, etc.) are evaluated using conventional methods of structural design. These 
            properties are based upon full cross-section dimensions, effective widths, or net section, as 
            applicable. 
            Effective Width Method 
               For the design of tension members, both gross and net sections are employed when 
            computing the nominal tensile strength [resistance] of the axially loaded tension members. 
               For flexural members and axially loaded compression members, both full and effective 
            dimensions are used to compute cross-sectional properties. The full dimensions are used when 
            calculating the critical load or moment, while the effective dimensions, evaluated at the stress 
            corresponding to the critical load or moment, are used to calculate the nominal strength 
            [resistance]. For serviceability consideration, the effective dimension should be determined for 
            the compressive stress in the element corresponding to the service load. Peköz (1986a and 1986b) 
            discussed this concept in more detail. 
               Section 3 of Part I of the AISI Design Manual (AISI, 2013) deals with the calculation of cross-
            sectional properties for C-sections, Z-sections, angles, hat sections, and decks. 
            Direct Strength Method 
               The Direct Strength Method uses the gross or net cross-section properties in member design. 
            It considers local buckling through the whole cross-section and takes the interaction of the 
            elements into consideration.

            B7 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 

               In this edition of the Specification, only the delivered minimum thickness is addressed under 
            this section. Other quality control and quality assurance issues may be considered in future 
            editions. 
             
              B7.1 Delivered Minimum Thickness 

                 Sheet and strip steels, both coated and uncoated, may be ordered to nominal or minimum 
              thickness. If the steel is ordered to minimum thickness, all thickness tolerances are over (+) and 
              nothing under (-). If the steel is ordered to nominal thickness, the thickness tolerances are 
              divided equally between over and under. Therefore, in order to provide a similar material 
              thickness applicable to both methods of ordering sheet and strip steel, it was decided to 
              require that the delivered thickness of a cold-formed product be at least 95 percent of the 
              design thickness. Thus, it is apparent that a portion of the safety factor or resistance factor may 
              be considered to cover minor negative thickness tolerances. 
                 Generally, thickness measurements should be made in the center of flanges. For decking 
              and siding, measurements should be made as close as practical to the center of the first full 
              flat of the section. Thickness measurements should not be made closer to edges than the 
              minimum distances specified in ASTM A568 Standard. 
                 The responsibility of meeting this requirement for a cold-formed product is clearly that of 
              the manufacturer of the product, not the steel producer.

            C. DESIGN FOR STABILITY  
            C1 Design for System Stability 

               In previous editions of the Specification, concluding with its 2012 edition, the primary 
            technique for considering system stability was the effective length method, mainly structured as 
            first introduced in the 1961 AISC Specification (AISC, 1961). Characteristic for this approach 
            was that the member strength calculation models employing an effective length factor, K, were 
            relied upon for considering the effects of residual stresses and geometric imperfections. 
            Consideration of various sources of deformation, such as those at connections and those 
            resulting from member shear, were not previously prescribed and the manner in which they 
            were captured was largely dependent on the standard practice of various constituent industries 
            and the judgment of individual professionals. The structure of the Specification implied the 
            usage of first-order elastic analysis of a geometrically undisturbed structure, where the second-
            order effects were crudely captured through the approximate amplifiers embedded in the 
            interaction equations. In 2006, based on the study by Sarawit and Peköz (2006) and the similar 
            methodology in ANSI/AISC 360-05 (AISC, 2005), Appendix 2 of the Specification (AISI, 2007a 
            and 2012a) incorporating a notional load approach was added. Supplied as an alternative to the 
            effective length method, the notional load approach required that the member and system second-
            order effects be considered directly through an elastic analysis capable of establishing 
            equilibrium on a deformed structure. In this analysis, initial imperfections were captured 
            through the application of notional forces while stiffnesses used in such an analysis were 
            reduced to model the effect of section softening due to inelastic deformations, including 
            residual stresses, and to account for the strength reduction factor applied to column strength. 
            For further background on AISI S100-12 (AISI, 2010a), the user is referred to the Commentary to 
            AISI S100-12 (AISI, 2012b). 
               Similar to ANSI/AISC 360-10 (AISC, 2010a), recognizing the interrelated roles of analysis 
            and member proportioning in assessing and assuring the overall system stability, the 
            Specification introduced the concept of “method of design.” Therein, the term “design” refers to 
            the comprehensive process of determining the required and available member strength [effects 
            due to factored loads and member factored resistance], thus incorporating analysis, definition of 
            imperfections, identifying sources of deformation, and determining the member strength. As 
            described above, it is possible to capture many such effects either through determination of 
            required forces (analysis) or through determination of available strength [factored resistance] 
            (member proportioning). It is, therefore, crucial that the processes of determining the required 
            and available member strengths [effects of factored loads and factored resistance] within any 
            particular method of design are compatible. 
               In 2016, the Specification was reorganized whereby the interaction equations were decoupled 
            from the analysis requirements and specific effects affecting system stability. In addition, the 
            Specification relaxed the requirement that the bending moment ( M) should be defined with 
            respect to the centroidal axis of the effective section. For ideally pin-ended beam-columns, when 
            determining applied bending from a compressive force, eccentricity from the line of 
            compressive action may be increased if the effective centroid (accounting for local buckling) is 
            considered. However, for continuous members or members with end restraint or members with 
            support restrained in a manner that reduces the neutral axis eccentricity between gross and 
            effective sections, this phenomenon is minor as the line of action of the force moves with the 
            buckling deformations due to the continuity of the structure, and calculation of the required

            bending moment [moment due to factored loads] about the gross centroidal axes is appropriate. 
               The Specification permits the usage of any method of design capable of assessing the stability 
            of both the system and each of its individual members, provided it considers items (a) through 
            (f) from Specification Section C1. The Specification offers three such design methods, subject to the 
            limitations stipulated within each of the methods. However, it is not the intention of the 
            Specification to prefer any of the methods of design enclosed therein, including approaches 
            incorporating inelastic analyses, or to prevent the usage of any methods of design not stated 
            therein, provided such a method considers the above items.  
               The load-displacement response resulting from a second-order elastic analysis is nonlinear. For 
            this reason, and to assure that consistent reliability can be achieved through deployment of 
            LRFD, LSD, or ASD, all load-dependent effects must be determined using either LRFD or LSD 
            load combinations or 1.6 times the ASD load combinations. Subsequently, if ASD is used in the 
            design, such effect should be divided by 1.6 to arrive at required member forces. Consequently, 
            application of ASD in this regard may be conservative in systems for which the live-to-dead load 
            ratio is relatively low. 
               Unbraced length, as used in Specification Section C1, is considered to occur between distinct 
            bracing points possessing adequate strength and stiffness to restrain their translation and/or 
            rotation, as applicable. Methods of satisfying the bracing requirement are provided in 
            Specification Section C2. The requirements of Specification Section C2 are not applicable to 
            bracing that is included in the analysis of the overall structure as part of the overall force-
            resisting system. 
               Stiffness modification requirements of Specification Section C1.1 and C1.2 are intended only 
            for the strength and stability checks under factored load combinations, as prescribed in those 
            sections. An analysis utilizing such stiffnesses may not be suitable for many displacement-
            related design considerations. Unreduced (nominal) stiffness is considered appropriate for 
            considering serviceability, such as deflection, drift and vibrations, or for calculating many other 
            stiffness-based properties or design checks, including period, seismic drift, and seismic stability 
            factor. 
             
              C1.1 Direct Analysis Method Using Rigorous Second-Order Elastic Analysis 

                 The provisions of this section are based on Sarawit (2003), Sarawit and Peköz (2006), and 
              ANSI/AISC 360-10 (AISC, 2010a). This method of design effectively incorporates the notional 
              load approach, previously included in Appendix 2 of AISI S100-12. The study by Sarawit and 
              Peköz on industrial steel storage racks at Cornell University (Sarawit, 2003) was sponsored 
              by the Rack Manufacturers Institute and the American Iron and Steel Institute. The subject of 
              notional loads is discussed fully in the Commentary to Chapter C of ANSI/AISC 360-10 
              (2010a). The application of the direct analysis method to cold-formed steel structures has to 
              consider the items (a) through (f) listed in Specification Section C1, including frequently 
              encountered flexural-torsional buckling, semi-rigid joints and local instabilities. In Sarawit 
              (2003), and Sarawit and Peköz (2006), it was shown that the direct analysis method gives more 
              accurate results than the effective length method. 
                 Required strengths [effects due to factored loads] are determined by analysis according to 
              Specification Section C1.1.1 and the members have to satisfy the provisions of Section H1 of 
              the Specification. The work by Sarawit and Peköz is based on a linear moment-axial 
              interaction equation, as depicted in Specification Section H1.2. It is the position of the 
              committee that such a model adequately captures the interaction of a wide variety of cold-

              formed steel shapes subject to different forms of buckling, axes of bending and buckling modes 
              for the design methods proposed herein, including the direct analysis method. Further 
              background on interaction equations is provided in the commentary to Specification Section 
              H1.2.   
                 Since the frame stability is considered by the direct analysis method, nominal axial strength 
              [resistance] in Specification Chapters D and E should be determined considering the flexural 
              buckling effective length equal to the unbraced length (i.e., K x  =K y  = 1.0). It is important to 
              recognize that the application of the direct analysis method does not alter the torsional effective 
              length factor, K t , which could be larger or smaller than 1.0, depending on the member 
              boundary conditions. As an example, one can consider the case of a C-section cantilevered 
              column with torsional and flexural fixity at the base. If designed using the direct analysis 
              method, the calculations of available strength [factored resistance] would be based on K x  =K y  =1.0 
              when computing flexural buckling stresses as prescribed by Chapter E. However, a K t  = 2.0 
              would be used in computing the flexural-torsional buckling stress. 
                 Any type of second-order elastic analysis capable of establishing static equilibrium on the 
              displaced structure is permitted. Two examples of such analyses are the stability functions 
              approach and the geometric stiffness approach. The latter is typically implemented in 
              commercially available software. It is required to carry out a second-order analysis that 
              considers both the effect of loads acting on the deflected shape of a member between joints or 
              nodes (P-δ effects) and the effect of loads acting on the displaced location of joints or nodes in a 
              structure (P-∆ effects). On a member level, P-δ effects need to be modeled explicitly. One 
              possible method of accomplishing this is to employ an elastic analysis capable of capturing 
              only P-∆ effects whereby P-δ effects are accounted for by modeling individual columns as a 
              serious of short column segments separated by intermediate nodes. These intermediate nodes 
              do not need to account for the initial out-of-straightness for the member. This is because for 
              members, the design equations based on flexural buckling column curves include the presence 
              of the initial imperfections along the member length.  
                 As an alternative to an elastic method of analysis capable of capturing both P- ∆ and P- δ 
              effects, users are permitted to employ a mixed approach, whereby P-∆ effects are captured 
              explicitly in the analysis with the results of such an analysis subsequently amplified by the 
              coefficient B 1 , as defined in Specification Section C1.2. This method of analysis is typical of 
              commercially available analysis software commonly used in practice. Relatively small 
              conservativism occurs in moment frame systems due to the application of B 1  to both sway 
              and non-sway components of the calculated moment. 
                 Second-order frame analysis within the direct analysis method of design is permitted either 
              on the out-of-plumb geometry without notional loads or on the plumb geometry by applying 
              notional loads or minimum lateral loads as defined in Specification Section C1.1.1.2. Initial 
              displacements similar in configuration to both displacements due to loading and anticipated 
              buckling modes should be considered in the modeling of imperfections. The imperfections 
              required to be considered in this section are imperfections in the locations of points of 
              intersection of members. In typical building structures, the important imperfection of this 
              type is the out-of-plumbness of columns. Initial out-of-straightness of individual members is 
              not addressed in this section; it is accounted for in the compression member design 
              provisions of Chapter E and need not be considered explicitly in the analysis as long as it is 
              within the limits prescribed by the standard practice governing the member fabrication. The 
              magnitude of the initial displacements should be based on permissible construction

              force at the base of the structure, equal and opposite in direction to the sum of all notional 
              loads, distributed among vertical load-carrying elements in the same proportion as the gravity 
              load supported by those elements. The notional loads can also lead to additional overturning 
              effects, which are not fictitious. An out-of-plumbness of 1/240, based on the Rack 
              Manufacturer’s Institute Specification, RMI MH16.1:2008 (RMI, 2008), is selected as 
              appropriate or conservative for use in a wide variety of cold-formed steel structures. An out-
              of-plumbness of 1/500, representing the maximum tolerance on column plumbness, is 
              specified in the AISC 303. The usage of values smaller than 1/240 is permitted provided such 
              values are substantiated by the applicable quality assurance standard or project-specific 
              requirements. Various codes, such as EN 1993-1 (ECS, 2005), provide criteria and methods of 
              computing the initial imperfection as a function of the number of stories and the number of 
              participating columns in the resistance plane. For most building structures, the requirement 
              regarding notional load direction may be satisfied as follows: For load combinations that do not 
              include lateral loading, consider two alternative orthogonal directions of notional load 
              application, in a positive and a negative sense in each of the two directions, in the same 
              direction at all levels; for load combinations that include lateral loading, apply all notional 
              loads in the direction of the resultant of all lateral loads in the combination. The notional load 
              concept is applicable to all types of structures, but the specific requirements (1) through (3) 
              given in Specification C1.1.1.2(b) are applicable only for the particular class of structure 
              identified therein. 
                 If second-order elastic analysis is used, whereby the effects of inelasticity and uncertainty 
              are not  explicitly included in the analysis, all stiffnesses maintaining the stability of the system 
              are to be reduced as specified in Specification Section C1.1.1.3. In the application of the direct 
              analysis method in ANSI/AISC 360-10   (AISC, 2010a), this results in a stiffness reduction factor 
              of 0.8 for slender columns, capable of resisting factored axial loads of up to 0.5P y . The factor 
              of 0.8 is equivalent to the margin of safety implied by a strength reduction factor 0.9, 
              prescribed in the ANSI/AISC 360-10 Chapter E, multiplied by the elastic flexural buckling 
              column curve adjustment coefficient of 0.877. In the development of the direct analysis method, 
              as implemented in ANSI/AISC 360-10, a distributed plasticity analysis was used. It can be 
              shown, using distributed plasticity analysis, that using a factored elastic modulus, E, and 
              yield stress, F y , in the analysis will yield the same P-M interaction curve as if nominal values 
              of E and F y  were used in the analysis and subsequently the abscissa and the ordinate of the P-
              M interaction curve are factored (White et al., 2006). However, a ten percent (10%) reduction 
              in member stiffness EI, namely multiplying EI by 0.9, is substantiated by Sarawit and Peköz 
              for the cold-formed steel members whose required axial force does not exceed 0.5P y . 
              Specifically, Sarawit and Peköz (2006) showed that for typical industrial storage rack frames 
              with a wide variety of section properties, configurations, and behavior modes, a reduction of 
              10 percent in member stiffnesses results in an increased conservatism of 10 percent in the 
              calculated load-carrying capacity. A 20 percent (20%) reduction in member stiffnesses would 
              lead to an increased conservatism of 20 percent (20%) in the calculated load-carrying capacity. 
              However, a parametric study of individual columns in Sarawit and Peköz (2006) shows that

              some unconservative results can be obtained in a few instances if the stiffness of members is 
              not reduced in the analysis. Reducing the stiffness by 10 percent gives satisfactory results for 
              these cases.  
                 The study by Sarawit and Peköz did not incorporate the members with sections subjected 
              to the required axial force in excess of 0.5P y . It is furthermore not expected that such sections 
              would be commonly found in cold-formed steel framing applications. However, to address 
              the full scope of the Specification, the committee’s position is that such occurrences could be 
              adequately addressed by applying the ANSI/AISC 360-10 (2010a) stiffness modifier, τb , which 
              in addition to 0.9, has the role of capturing additional stiffness softness characteristic for 
              stockier columns with the axial force approaching P y . This conclusion is further supported by 
              the study by Ziemian and Kissell (2010) on aluminum members which noted a limited impact 
              of τ b  even for fairly stocky columns. In addition, the study findings suggest the ability to use 
              a higher value of the reduced stiffness given the usage of a linear interaction diagram 
              compared to a multi-linear bulged-forward interaction diagram in ANSI/AISC 360-10 
              (2010a). 
                 Initial imperfections, as considered in this design method when performing an analysis, 
              refer to the imperfections at the points of member intersections (i.e., column out-of-
              plumbness). Column out-of-straightness, referring to the initial imperfection occurring 
              between the points of member intersections, is in turn not considered in the analysis, but its 
              influence is considered in the column strength curves when computing the available strength 
              [factored resistance] per Chapter E. In certain cases, the user may experience difficulty in 
              determining the effective member length (i.e., KL x =L x  and KL y =L y ) for use in computations of 
              available strength per Chapter E. An example of such a difficulty would be the exercise of 
              determining the effective length of a gable long-span portal frame rafter. In such a case, the 
              user may directly model initial imperfections along the length of the member and in 
              exchange determine the available strength [factored resistance] based on the strength of the 
              member section (i.e, L x  and L y  of zero). The initial displacements should be considered in the 
              direction in which the effective member length KL=L is taken as zero. Similarly, even when 
              member length is less ambiguous, such as in the cases of typical floor columns with clearly 
              defined points of member intersection, it is permitted to explicitly include the column out-of-
              straightness in the analysis, and in exchange determining the available axial strength [factored 
              resistance] considering local and distortional buckling only. Consideration of torsional and 
              flexural-torsional buckling would be unaffected by this option.  
                 It should be noted that the nominal axial and flexural strengths [resistances] computed per 
              Chapters D, E, F, G, H, I, K and M are not intended to be calculated using the reduced value 
              of stiffness. 
             
              C1.2 Direct Analysis Method Using Amplified First-Order Elastic Analysis 

                 The design method presented in this section is identical to that offered in Specification 
              Section C1.1, except that it is permitted to perform the design using an amplified first-order 
              elastic analysis. With this approach, the non-sway and sway components of the member 
              moments resulting from a first-order elastic analysis are amplified by factors B 1  and B 2 , 
              respectively. Additionally, sway moment amplification will translate into additional axial 
              forces in the system columns and thereby amplification of the column forces resulting from 
              sway effects by the factor B 2  is required as well. The amplified first-order elastic analysis

              method, as configured here, was first introduced in the 1986 AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 
              1986), and has also been used historically in some form in other major design specifications, 
              such as ACI 318-14 (ACI, 2014). Both B 1  and B 2  represent nonlinear algebraic convergence 
              functions relating the member forces from the undeformed structure equilibrium to the forces 
              in a displaced member and structure, respectively. Consequently, diverging values of these 
              functions will indicate instability. Similarly, a large value of B 2  is associated with a stability 
              critical system. The reader will recognize the mathematical similarity of the amplifier 
              included in the P-M interaction equation in AISI S100-12 (AISI, 2012a) with B 1  and B 2 . The 
              advantage of B 1  and B 2  over the amplifier previously used in the Specification is their ability to 
              distinguish between the non-sway (member) and sway (story) effects and consequently 
              capture the appropriate level of amplification associated with each effect. Consequently, it 
              avoids potentially grossly conservative or unconservative results resulting from the 
              application of a single amplifier previously contained in the Specification interaction 
              equations. As B 1  and B 2  are stiffness-based terms representing an integral part of the analysis 
              process, their application within the framework of Direct Analysis Method of design must be 
              associated with the same stiffness reductions as mandated by the method for use in the first-
              order elastic analysis, with the exception that B 1  must be computed with a reduced stiffness 
              even for members not contributing to the system stability. The evaluation of B 2  as configured 
              in these provisions is based upon the story drift approach, rather than column buckling 
              analogy. As a result, this analysis can be employed with any method of design, without the 
              need to determine the effective length factor associated with story sway.  F and Δ F  in 
              Specification Equation C1.2.1.1-7 may be based on any lateral loading that provides a 
              representative value of story lateral stiffness,  F/Δ F . The derivation of B 1  and B 2  was 
              presented in many references, including Chen and Lui (1991).   
                 The user should maintain awareness of the fact that the result of a first-order member 
              force amplification represents a real system effect in the form of additional member, 
              connection, bracing, foundation and anchorage forces. As a result of logistical convenience 
              within the commercially available design-analysis software packages, when amplified first-
              order analysis is used, B 1  and B 2  are typically applied at the member proportioning stage, thus 
              excluding such forces from the result of the analysis. Consequently, care should be taken to 
              incorporate the effect of the amplifiers in the proportioning of other elements of the system, 
              such as those listed above. 
                 Further background on this method of analysis is presented in the Commentary to the 
              ANSI/AISC 360-10 (2010b).   
             
              C1.3 Effective Length Method 

                 The design method presented in this Specification section represents the traditional 
              method of design, first introduced in the 1961 AISC Specification (AISC, 1961). Recognizing 
              its traditional association with the amplified first-order elastic analysis in the 1986, 1993 and 
              1999 AISC Specifications, it is presented in such a form herein, though it is not the intention 
              of the committee to limit the usages of other methods of analysis compatible with the effective 
              length method framework as long as the items (a) through (f) listed in Specification Section C1 
              are considered. Notwithstanding the different formulation of second-order effect amplifiers, the 
              effective length method historically constituted the primary approach of design for stability up 
              until and including the 2012 edition of the Specification (AISI, 2012a), and the sole such

              approach before the 2007 edition of the Specification (AISI 2007a) which introduced the 
              notional load approach (direct analysis method) in its Appendix 2. 
                 Unlike the methods of design set forth in Specification Sections C1.1 and C1.2, the effective 
              length method relies on the calculations of available strength [factored resistance] through the 
              application of effective length (typically larger than the actual unbraced member length) and the 
              empirical column curves, incorporating a modified elastic and inelastic buckling range, to 
              capture the effects of geometric imperfections and loss of stiffness due to residual stresses, 
              local yielding as the capacity is approached, as well as other effects. As a result of this, the 
              analysis, performed using nominal stiffnesses, need only capture the P-∆ and P-δ effects. Also, 
              given the application of the effective length factor in member proportioning, notional forces are 
              not required to safely configure a column solely on the basis of the axial forces and in-plane 
              bending. Unfortunately, the application of the effective length factor for flexural buckling does 
              not impart the forces resulting from initial imperfections into beams, framing connections, 
              stability braces, foundations and base anchorage, which is particularly critical in designs 
              controlled by gravity load combinations. For this reason, the Specification stipulates the 
              application of notional forces, as described in Specification Section C1.1 in conjunction with all 
              gravity load combinations.   
                 In the design, many systems can be classified as sway and non-sway. For the former, 
              effective length factor, K x  or K y , as applicable, will be larger than 1.0; and for the latter, K x  or 
              Ky , as applicable, can typically be taken as 1.0 or less, depending upon specific boundary 
              conditions. 
                 The calculation of the effective length factor, K, for flexural buckling depends upon the axis of 
              bending, frame configuration, boundary conditions, and the stiffness properties of the column 
              and the members attached thereto. For further information on various methods of computing 
              K, the user is referred to Chen and Lui (1991), AISC Specification (2010a) and ASCE Task 
              Committee on Effective Length Method (1997).   
                 When B 2  exceeds 1.5, this method of design is not permitted. Specifically, research found 
              that the method considerably underestimates the internal system forces when B 2  exceeds 1.5, 
              where B 2  is evaluated on the basis of unreduced (nominal) stiffness (White et al., 2006).   
             
            C2 Member Bracing 

               The provisions of this section cover the design of torsion (also known as primary, first-
            order, or load-resisting) bracing in Section C2.2 and stability (also known as secondary, second-
            order, or deformation-resisting) bracing in Sections C2.1 and C2.3. 
               Torsion bracing develops forces even when equilibrium in the undeformed shape is 
            considered. For example, bracing designed to resist twist in a C-section loaded in the plane of 
            the web develops forces due to the location of the shear center not coinciding with the web, and 
            is considered torsion, or first-order, bracing. Also, bracing designed to resist twist in a Z-section 
            will develop forces when it is desired to have loading and response occur in a geometric axis 
            that does not coincide with a cross-section principal axis, and is also considered torsion, or first-
            order, bracing. First-order or torsion braces, traditionally, are designed with strength criteria 
            alone. The forces that develop to directly resist the first-order demands in torsion braces scale 
            directly with the applied loads and can be significant. The relatively large magnitude of the 
            brace forces and the fact that they may be predicted independently of brace stiffness makes 
            their design criteria slightly simpler than stability bracing, as explained below. A First-Order

            Analysis that includes cross-section torsion can provide a means to predict bracing forces for 
            torsion braces.  
               Stability bracing, on the other hand, is used to prevent a member from buckling. Stability 
            bracing receives forces only if equilibrium in the deformed (buckled) shape requires forces in 
            the braces. For example, bracing designed to resist minor-axis flexural buckling in a C-section is 
            considered a stability, or second-order, bracing. If stability braces are stiff enough, they only 
            develop very small forces. As a result, stability braces are typically designed with both stiffness 
            and strength criteria. A second-order analysis that includes the potential buckling deformations the 
            brace is intended to restrict along with appropriate imperfections can provide a means to 
            predict bracing forces for stability braces as detailed further in Section C2.3. 
               Cases where a brace may need to act as both a torsion and a stability brace are possible. In 
            such cases, the strength demands for torsion braces generally exceed those for stability braces 
            and traditionally have been employed without additional consideration for behavior as a 
            stability brace. For other cases beyond the scope of the Specification, brace forces predicted from a 
            proper second-order analysis that can capture both torsion and stability brace demands are 
            recommended.                                                              B  
              C2.1 Symmetrical Beams and Columns 

                 There are no simple, generally accepted techniques for determining the required strength 
              [effect due to factored loads] and stiffness for discrete braces in steel construction. Winter 
              (1960) offered a partial solution and others have extended this knowledge (Haussler, 1964; 
              Haussler and Pahers, 1973; Lutz and Fisher, 1985; Salmon and Johnson, 1990; Yura, 1993; 
              SSRC, 1993). The design engineer is encouraged to seek out the stated references to obtain 
              guidance for design of a brace or brace system.                                  B  
              C2.2 C-Section and Z-Section Beams 

                 C-sections and Z-sections used as beams to support transverse loads applied in the plane 
              of the web may twist and deflect laterally unless adequate lateral supports are provided. 
              Section C2.2 of the Specification includes the requirements for spacing and design of braces, 
              when neither flange of the beam is braced by deck or sheathing material. The bracing 
              requirements for members having one flange connected to deck or sheathing materials are 
              provided in Specification Section I6.4.1.                                         B

                      Stability of the Section 

                (a) Bracing of C-Section Beams 
                  If C-sections are used singly as beams, rather than being paired to form I-sections, 
                   they should be braced at intervals so as to prevent them from rotating in the manner 
                   indicated in Figure C-C2.2.1-1. Figure C-C2.2.1-2, for simplicity, shows two C-sections 
                   braced at intervals against each other. The situation is evidently much the same as in 
                   the composite I-section of Figure C-I1.1-2, except that the role of the connectors is now 
                   played by the braces. The difference is that the two C-sections are not in contact, and 
                   that the spacing of braces is generally considerably larger than the connector spacing. 
                   In consequence, each C-section may actually rotate very slightly between braces, and 
                   this will cause some additional stresses, which superimpose on the usual, simple 
                   bending stresses. Bracing should be so arranged that: (1) these additional stresses are

                   small enough not to reduce the load-carrying capacity of the C-section (as compared to 
                   what it would be in the continuously braced condition), and (2) rotations should be 
                   kept small enough to be unobjectionable on the order of one to two degrees. 
                  In order to obtain the information for developing bracing provisions, different C-
                   section shapes were tested at Cornell University (Winter, 1970). Each of these was 
                   tested with full, continuous bracing; without any bracing; and with intermediate 
                   bracing at two different spacings. In addition to this experimental work, an 
                   approximate method of analysis was developed and checked against the test results. A 
                   condensed account of this work was given by Winter, Lansing and McCalley (1949b). It 
                   is indicated in the reference that the above requirements are satisfied for most 
                   distributions of beam load if between supports not less than three equidistant braces are 
                   placed (i.e., at quarter-points of the span, or closer). The exception is the case where a 
                   large part of the total load of the beam is concentrated over a short portion of the span; 
                   in this case, an additional brace should be placed at such a load. Correspondingly, 
                   previous editions of the AISI Specification (AISI, 1986; AISI, 1991) provided that the 
                   distance between braces should not be greater than one-quarter of the span and 
                   defined the conditions under which an additional brace should be placed at a load 
                   concentration. 
                  For such braces to be effective, it is necessary that their spacing be appropriately

                   limited and their strength should suffice to provide the force required to prevent the C-
                   section from rotating. It is also necessary to determine the forces that will act in braces, 
                   such as those forces shown in Figure C-C2.2.1-3. These forces are found if one considers 
                   that the action of a load applied in the plane of the web (which causes a torque Qm) is 
                   equivalent to that same load when applied at the shear center (where it causes no 
                   torque) plus two forces P = Qm/d which, together, produce the same torque Qm. As is 
                   sketched in Figure C-C2.2.1-4 and shown in some detail by Winter, Lansing and 
                   McCalley (1949b), each half of the channel can then be regarded as a continuous beam 
                   loaded by the horizontal forces and supported at the brace points. The horizontal brace 
                   force is then, simply, the appropriate reaction of this continuous beam. The provisions 
                   of Specification Section C2.2.1 provide expressions for determining bracing forces P L1  
                   and P L2 , which the braces are required to resist at each flange.

                (b) Bracing of Z-Section Beams 
                  Most Z-sections are anti-symmetrical about the vertical and horizontal centroidal 
                   axes; i.e., they are point-symmetrical. In view of this, the centroid and the shear center 
                   coincide and are located at the midpoint of the web. A load applied in the plane of the 
                   web has, then, no lever arm about the shear center (m = 0) and does not tend to produce 
                   the kind of rotation that a similar load would produce on a C-section. However, in Z-

                   sections the principal axes are oblique to the web (Figure C-C2.2.1-5). A load applied in 
                   the plane of the web, resolved in the direction of the two axes, produces deflections 
                   along each of them. By projecting these deflections onto the horizontal and vertical 
                   planes, it is found that a Z-beam loaded vertically in the plane of the web deflects not 
                   only vertically but also horizontally. If such deflection is permitted to occur, then the 
                   loads, moving sideways with the beam, are no longer in the same plane with the 
                   reactions at the ends. In consequence, the loads produce a twisting moment about the 
                   line connecting the reactions. In this manner it is seen that a Z-beam, unbraced between 
                   ends and loaded in the plane of the web, deflects laterally and also twists. Not only are 
                   these deformations likely to interfere with the proper functioning of the beam, but the 
                   additional stresses caused by them produce failure at a load considerably lower than 
                   when the same beam is used fully braced. 
                  In order to obtain information for developing appropriate bracing provisions, tests 
                   have been carried out on three different Z-sections at Cornell University, unbraced as 
                   well as with variously spaced intermediate braces. In addition, an approximate method 
                   of analysis has been developed and checked against the test results. An account of this 
                   work was given by Zetlin and Winter (1955b). Briefly, it is shown that intermittently 
                   braced Z-beams can be analyzed in much the same way as intermittently braced C-
                   beams. It is merely necessary, at the point of each actual vertical load Q, to apply a 
                   fictitious horizontal load, Q(I xy /I x ) or Q[I xy /(2I x )], to each flange. One can then compute 
                   the vertical and horizontal deflections, and the corresponding stresses, in conventional 
                   ways by utilizing the convenient axes x and y (rather than 1 and 2, Figure C-C2.2.1-5), 
                   except that certain modified section properties have to be used. To control the lateral 
                   deflection, brace forces, P, must statically balance the fictitious force. 






















                                                                        
                                       Figure C-C2.2.1-5 Principal Axis of Z-Section 
                  In this manner it has been shown that as to location of braces, the same provisions 
                   that apply to C-sections are also adequate for Z-sections. Likewise, the forces in the 
                   braces are again obtained as the reactions of continuous beams horizontally loaded by 
                   fictitious loads, P. It should, however, be noted that the direction of the bracing forces

                   in Z-beams is different from the direction in C-beams. In the Z-beam, the bracing forces 
                   are acting in the same direction, as shown in Figure C-C2.2.1-5, in order to constrain 
                   bending of the section about the axis x-x. The directions of the bracing forces in the C-
                   beam flanges are in the opposite direction, as shown in Figure C-C2.2.1-3, in order to 
                   resist the torsion caused by the applied load. In the previous edition of the Specification, 
                   the magnitude of the Z-beam bracing force was shown as P = Q(I xy /I x ) on each flange. 
                   In 2001, this force was corrected to P = Q[I xy /(2I x )]. 
                (c) Slope Effect and Eccentricity 
                  For a C- or Z-section member subjected to an arbitrary load, bracing forces, P L1  and 
                   PL2 , on flanges need to resist: (1) force component P x  that is perpendicular to the web, (2) 
                   the torsion caused by eccentricity about the shear center, and (3) for the Z-section 
                   member, the lateral movement caused by component P y , that is parallel to the web.  
                  To develop a set of equations applicable to any loading conditions, the x and y axes 
                   are oriented such that one of the flanges is located in the quadrant with both x and y 
                   axes positive. Since the torsion should be calculated about the shear center, coordinates 
                   xs  and y s , that go through the shear center and parallel to x and y axes, are established. 
                   Load eccentricities e x  and e y  should be measured based on x s  and y s  coordinate system.

                   where d = Overall depth of the web; e sx , e sy  = Eccentricities of load about the shear

                   direction, respectively; M z  = Torsional moment about the shear center; and P L1  = 
                   Bracing force applied to the flange located in the quadrant with both positive x and y 
                   axes, and P L2  = Bracing force applied on the other flange. Positive P L1  and P L2  indicate 
                   that a restraint is required to prevent the movement of the corresponding flange in the 
                   negative x-direction.

                   where I x , I xy  = Unreduced moment of inertia and product of inertia, respectively. Other 
                   variables are defined under the discussion for C-section members.  
                  Assuming that a gravity load, P, acts at 1/3 of the top flange width, b f , and the Z-
                   section member rests on a sloped roof with an angle of θ, P x  = -Psinθ; P y  = -Pcosθ; e sx  = 
                   bf /3; e sy  = d/2 and M z  = Psinθ(d/2) - Pcosθ(b f /3). Substituting the above expressions 
                   into Equations C-C2.2.1-6 and C-C2.2.1-7 results in:

                   In considering the distribution of loads and the braces along the member length, it is 
                   required that the resistance at each brace location along the member length be greater 
                   than or equal to the design load within a distance of 0.5a on each side of the brace for 
                   distributed loads. For concentrated loads, the resistance at each brace location should 
                   be greater than or equal to the concentrated load within a distance 0.3a on each side of 
                   the brace, plus 1.4(1-l/a) times each load located farther than 0.3a but not farther than 
                   1.0a from the brace. In the above, “a” is the distance between centerline of braces along 
                   the member length and “l” is the distance from concentrated load to the brace to be

                   considered.  
                  In Specification Section C2.2.1, a top-bar is added to the variables designed as the 
                   design load, which are calculated in accordance with ASD, LRFD, or LSD load 
                   combinations depending on the design method used. 
              (d) Spacing of Braces 
                  During the period from 1956 through 1996, the AISI Specification required that braces 
                   be attached both to the top and bottom flanges of the beam, at the ends and at intervals 
                   not greater than one-quarter of the span length, in such a manner as to prevent tipping 
                   at the ends and lateral deflection of either flange in either direction at intermediate 
                   braces. The lateral-torsional buckling equations provided in Specification Sections F2 and 
                   F3 can be used to predict the moment capacity of the member. Beam tests conducted by 
                   Ellifritt, Sputo and Haynes (1992) have shown that for typical sections, a mid-span 
                   brace may reduce service load horizontal deflections and rotations by as much as 80 
                   percent when compared to a completely unbraced beam. However, the restraining 
                   effect of braces may change the failure mode from lateral-torsional buckling to distortional 
                   buckling of the flange and lip at a brace point. The natural tendency of the member 
                   under vertical load is to twist and translate in such a manner as to relieve the 
                   compression on the lip. When such movement is restrained by intermediate braces, the 
                   compression on the stiffening lip is not relieved, and may increase. In this case, local 
                   distortional buckling may occur at loads lower than that predicted by the lateral-torsional 
                   buckling equations of Specification Sections F2 and F3. 
                  Research (Ellifritt, Sputo and Haynes, 1992) has also shown that the lateral-torsional 
                   buckling equations of Specification Sections F2 and F3 predict loads, which are 
                   conservative for cases where one mid-span brace is used but may be unconservative 
                   where more than one intermediate brace is used. Based on such research findings, 
                   Section C2.2.1 of the Specification was revised in 1996 to eliminate the requirement of 
                   quarter-point bracing. It is suggested that, minimally, a mid-span brace be used for C-
                   section and Z-section beams to control lateral deflection and rotation at service loads. 
                   The lateral-torsional buckling strength of an open cross-section member should be 
                   determined by Specification Sections F2 and F3 using the distance between centerlines of 
                   braces “a” as the unbraced length of the member “L” in all design equations. In any 
                   case, the user is permitted to perform tests, in accordance with Specification Section 
                   K2.1, as an alternative, or use a rigorous analysis, which accounts for biaxial bending 
                   and torsion. 
                  Section C2.2.1 of the Specification provides the lateral forces for which these discrete 
                   braces must be designed.  
                  The Specification permits omission of discrete braces when all loads and reactions on a 
                   beam are transmitted through members that frame into the section in such a manner as 
                   to effectively restrain the member against torsional rotation and lateral displacement. 
                   Frequently, this occurs in the end walls of metal buildings. 
                  In 2007, the title of this section was changed to clarify that it is and was formerly 
                   anticipated that the C- and Z-sections covered by these provisions would be 
                   supporting sheathing and be loaded as a result of providing this support function. The 
                   revised title reflects that the supported sheathing is not contributing to the strength and 
                   stiffness of these members by virtue of the nature of its connection to the C- and Z-
                   sections.

                      C- or Z-Section 

                   This section of the Specification reminds users that stability should be considered in 
                accordance with provisions of Section I6.4.1 or I6.4.2 for members with sheathing attached.

              C2.3 Bracing of Axially Loaded Compression Members 

                 In 2012, second-order analysis was introduced as a method for establishing the required 
              strength [brace force due to factored loads] and stiffness for column bracing. The analysis 
              includes consideration of the initial out-of-straightness of the compression member as well as 
              the bracing member properties, connections, and anchoring details. Specific requirements are 
              provided in Section C2.2.3. 
                 Alternatively, the bracing can be designed using the provisions provided in Specification 
              Section C2.3. The requirements for bracing a single compression member were developed 
              from a study by Green, et al. (2004) and adaptation of requirements in the AISC Specification 
              (AISC, 2010a). These bracing provisions ensure that an individual concentrically loaded 
              compression member can develop the required compressive axial strength [compressive axial 
              force due to factored loads]; however, they do not necessarily allow individual concentrically 
              loaded compression members to develop their fully braced capacity at an effective length 
              equal to the length between braces. The required bracing stiffness ensures that the translation 
              at the brace point is limited until the axial loads equal the required strength [compressive axial 
              force due to factored loads], P ra , which is determined in accordance with the applied load 
              combinations for the corresponding design method of ASD, LRFD, or LSD. The engineer 
              should recognize that a column braced to these provisions has an available strength [factored 
              resistance] equal to the required strength [compressive axial force due to factored loads], but not 
              in excess of the required strength [compressive axial force due to factored loads]. If the engineer 
              desires the available column strength [factored resistance] to exceed P ra , then the required brace 
              strength [brace force due to factored loads] designed for P ra  should be increased. If the engineer 
              desires the available column strength [factored resistance] to equal the fully braced column 
              strength, the required axial compressive strength [compressive axial force due to factored loads], 
              Pra , in Specification Equations C2.3-1, C2.3-2a and C2.3-2b should be replaced by the fully 
              braced column available strength [factored resistance], P n /Ωc  for ASD or φc Pn  for LRFD or LSD.  
                 The requirements for brace stiffness for a single compression member are similar to the 
              AISC provisions, with the exception that the number of braces is accounted for by including 
              the term 2(4-(2/n)). As a simplification, AISC assumes n = infinity, but this simplification is 
              considered too conservative for cold-formed steel structures. Analytical modeling by Sputo 
              and Beery (2006) has shown that these provisions may be applied to members of varied cross-
              sections. The safety factor (Ω=2.0) and resistance factor (φ=0.75) for calculating required brace 
              stiffness in Specification Equations C2.3-2a and C2.3-2b are the same as those used in the AISC 
              provisions (AISC, 2010a).  
                 The brace provisions for lateral translation assume that the braces are perpendicular to 
              the compression member being braced and located in the plane of buckling. For inclined brace 
              members, the required brace strength [brace force due to factored loads] and stiffness should be 
              increased as follows:

            D. MEMBERS IN TENSION 
               In 2010, the provisions for tension members were consolidated and moved from the 
            country-specific appendices to the main Specification. The available tensile strength [factored 
            resistance] of axially loaded cold-formed steel tension members is determined either by yielding 
            of the gross area of the cross-section or by rupture of the net area of the cross-section. At locations 
            of connections, the nominal tensile strength [resistance] is also limited by the available strengths 
            [factored resistances] specified in Specification Chapter J for tension in connected parts.  
             
            D2 Yielding of Gross Section 

               Yielding in the gross section indirectly provides a limit on the deformation that a tension 
            member can achieve. The definition of yielding in the gross section to determine the tensile 
            strength is well established in hot-rolled steel construction. 
               The resistance factor φt  = 0.90 and safety factor Ωt  = 1.67 used for yielding of the gross section 
            are consistent with the factors used in ANSI/AISC 360 Specification (AISC, 2010a) and CSA S16 
            Specification (CSA, 2009). 
             
            D3 Rupture of Net Section 

               The resistance factor of φt  = 0.75 and safety factor of Ωt  = 2.00 used for rupture of the net 
            section are consistent with the factors used in the ANSI/AISC 360 Specification (AISC, 2010a) 
            and CSA S16 Specification (CSA, 2009).

            E. MEMBERS IN COMPRESSION 
            E1 General Requirements 

               Cold-formed steel column members should be designed considering yielding and global 
            (flexural, flexural-torsional and torsional) buckling in accordance with Specification Section E2; local 
            buckling with yielding and global buckling in accordance with Specification Section E3; and 
            distortional buckling in accordance with Specification Section E4; as applicable. Design tables and 
            example problems may be found in Parts I and III of the AISI Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual 
            (AISI, 2013). 
               Two approaches can be used in column design: the Effective Width Method (EWM) and the 
            Direct Strength Method (DSM). The EWM traditionally addressed local and global buckling. In 
            2004, the distortional buckling strength prediction using DSM was adopted as an alternative 
            method.  
               The calibration of the EWM has been reported in the Commentary on the 1991 edition of the 
            AISI Specification. The brief discussion of the DSM is provided herein. In considering column 
            yielding and global buckling, the DSM is essentially the same as the EWM. However, the 
            approach of the two methods in predicting the strength due to local buckling is different. The 
            DSM strength curves for local and distortional buckling of a fully braced column are presented in 
            Figure C-E1-1. The curves are presented as a function of slenderness, which in this case refers to 
            slenderness in the local or distortional mode, as opposed to traditional long column 
            slenderness. Inelastic and post-buckling regimes are observed for both local and distortional 
            buckling modes. The magnitude of the post-buckling reserve for the distortional buckling mode is 
            less than the local buckling mode, as may be observed by the location of the strength curves in 
            relation to the critical elastic buckling curve. 
               The development and calibration of the DSM provisions for columns are reported in Schafer

            (2000, 2002). The reliability of the column provisions was determined using the test data of 
            Section B4.2 and the provisions of Section K2 of the Specification. Based on a target reliability, β, 
            of 2.5, a resistance factor, φ, of 0.84 was calculated for all the investigated columns. Based on this 
            information, the safety and resistance factors of Chapter E were determined for the prequalified 
            members. For the United States and Mexico, φ = 0.85 was selected; while for Canada, φ = 0.80, 
            since a slightly higher reliability, β, of 3.0 is employed. The safety factor, Ω, was back-calculated 
            from φ at an assumed dead-to-live load ratio of 1 to 5. Since the range of prequalified members is 
            relatively large, extensions of the DSM to geometries outside the prequalified set is allowed. 
            Given the uncertain nature of this extension, increased safety factors and reduced resistance 
            factors are applied in that case, per the rational engineering analysis provisions of Section A1.2(c) 
            of the Specification. 
               The provisions of Chapter E are summarized in Figure C-E1-2. The controlling strength is 
            either by Specification Section E3, which considers local buckling interaction with long column 
            buckling, or by Section E4, which considers the distortional mode alone. The controlling strength 
            (minimum predicted of the two modes) is highlighted for the examined members by the choice 
            of marker. Overall performance of the method can be judged by examination of Figure C-E1-2. 
            Scatter exists throughout the data set, but the trends in strength are clearly shown, and further, 
            the scatter (variance) is similar to that of the EWM.

               The development and calibration of the DSM provisions for columns with holes was 
            performed with experimental and simulation databases as reported in Moen and Schafer 
            (2009a) and summarized in Moen and Schafer (2011). Note that both databases contain only 
            lipped Cee cross-sections with discrete web holes because this is what was available in the 
            research literature at the time. However, the philosophy of employing elastic buckling 
            parameters (P cr , P crd , P cre ) to predict the ultimate strength of cold-formed steel columns with 
            holes was thoroughly validated in Moen and Schafer (2009a), and is assumed to hold true for 
            other cross-section shapes.

               The generality of the DSM approach for holes was demonstrated across experiments and 
            nonlinear finite element analysis collapse simulations across a wide range of spacing, shape, 
            and size of holes for both cold-formed steel columns and beams. Based on a target reliability, β, 
            of 2.5, the resistance factor, φ, was calculated as 0.94 (experiments) and 0.89 (simulations) for 
            columns with holes predicted to fail from local-global buckling interaction. For columns with 
            holes predicted to experience a distortional buckling failure mode, φ was calculated as 0.96 
            (experiments) and 0.91 (simulations). The prediction accuracy for DSM for members with holes 
            is greater than that for members without holes (Ganesan and Moen, 2012).  
             
            E2 Yielding and Global (Flexural, Flexural-Torsional and Torsional) Buckling 

                 In this section, the limit states of yielding and overall column buckling are discussed. 
              A. Yielding 
                It is well known that a very short, compact column under an axial load may fail by 
                 yielding. The yield load is determined by Equation C-E2-1: 
                        FAP      ygy =                                                               (C-E2-1) 
                 where A g  is the gross area of the column and F y  is the yield stress of steel. 
              B. Flexural Buckling of Columns 
              (a) Elastic Buckling Stress 
                A slender, axially loaded column may fail by overall flexural buckling if the cross-section 
                 of the column is a doubly-symmetric shape, closed shape (square or rectangular tube), 
                 cylindrical shape, or point-symmetric shape. For singly-symmetric shapes, flexural 
                 buckling is one of the possible failure modes. Wall studs connected with sheathing 
                 material can also fail by flexural buckling. 
                The elastic critical buckling load for a long column can be determined by the following 
                 Euler equation: 
                         π2 EI)P( cr e =                                                           (C-E2-2) 
                            )(KL 2

                 where (P cr )e  is the column buckling load in the elastic range, E is the modulus of elasticity, 
                 I is the moment of inertia, K is the effective length factor, and L is the unbraced length. 
                 Accordingly, the elastic column buckling stress is 
                            )P(         2
                     )F(           ==  cr e    π E
                   cr e                                                            (C-E2-3)  Ag         )(KL r/ 2

                 in which r is the radius of gyration of the full cross-section, and KL/r is the effective 
                 slenderness ratio. 
              (b) Inelastic Buckling Stress 
                When the elastic column buckling stress computed by Equation C-E2-3 exceeds the 
                 proportional limit, F pr , the column will buckle in the inelastic range. Prior to 1996, the 
                 following equation was used in the Specification for computing the inelastic column 
                 buckling stress: 
                              F   1F)F(          −=       y  cr    yI                                                           (C-E2-4) 
                                 )F(4 cr e 

                It should be noted that because Equation C-E2-4 is based on the assumption that 
                 Fpr  = F y /2, it is applicable only for (F cr )e  ≥ F y /2. 
                By using λc  as the column slenderness parameter instead of slenderness ratio, KL/r, 
                 Equation C-E2-4 can be rewritten as follows: 
                             2 F1)F(        λc cr I    −=    4  y                                                  (C-E2-5) 
                              
                    where 
                           Fy    KL F=λ          =     y
                     c                                                             (C-E2-6)  )(Fcr e   rπ  E

                Accordingly, Equation C-E2-5 is applicable only for λc  ≤  2. 
              (c) Nominal Axial Strength [Resistance] for Locally Stable Columns 
                If the individual components of compression members have small w/t ratios, local 
                 buckling will not occur before the compressive stress reaches the column buckling stress or 
                 the yield stress of steel. Therefore, the nominal axial strength [resistance] can be determined 
                 by the following equation: 
                  Pn   = A g Fcr                                                          (C-E2-7) 
                    where 
                    Pn   = Nominal axial strength [resistance] 
                    Ag  = Gross area of cross-section 
                    Fcr  = Column buckling stress 
                In the 1986 edition of the Specification, the nominal axial strength [resistance] for C- and Z-
                 sections and single angle sections was limited by Equation C-E2-8, which is determined 
                 by the local buckling stress of the unstiffened element and the area of the full cross-section: 
                            EAπ2
                  Pn =                                                             (C-E2-8) 
                             )/25.7(  tw 2

                This equation was deleted in the 1996 edition of the Specification based on a study 
                 conducted by Rasmussen at the University of Sydney (Rasmussen, 1994) and validated by 
                 Rasmussen and Hancock (1992).  
                In the 1996 Specification, the design equations for calculating the inelastic and elastic 
                 flexural buckling stresses were changed to those used in the AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 
                 1993). As given in Specification Section E2, these design equations are as follows: 

                  For                    2 )(=:≤λ c                  F658.0F    5.1            λn        c  y                                         (C-E2-9) 

                                  For                877.0   =:>λ      F   5.1           c       n        Fy                                          (C-E2-10)    2  λc 
                 where F n  is the nominal flexural buckling stress which can be either in the elastic range or 
                 in the inelastic range depending on the value of λc  =     F/F   ey    , and F e  is the elastic flexural 
                 buckling stress calculated by using Equation C-E2-3. Consequently, the equation for 
                 determining the nominal axial strength [resistance] can be written as:

                The revised column design equations (Equations C-E2-9 and C-E2-10) are based on a 
                 different basic strength model and were shown to be more accurate by Peköz and Sumer 
                 (1992). In this study, 299 test results on columns and beam-columns were evaluated. The 
                 test specimens included members with component elements in the post-local buckling 
                 range as well as those that were locally stable. The test specimens included members 
                 subject to flexural buckling as well as flexural-torsional buckling. 
                Because the revised column design equations represent the maximum strength with due 
                 consideration given to initial crookedness and can provide a better fit to test results, the 
                 required safety factor can be reduced. In addition, the revised equations enable the use of a 
                 single safety factor for all λc  values even though the nominal axial strength [resistance] of 
                 columns decreases as the slenderness increases because of initial out-of-straightness. By 
                 using the selected safety factor and resistance factor, the results obtained from the ASD and 
                 LRFD approaches would be approximately the same for a live-to-dead load ratio of 5.0. 
                The design provisions included in the AISI ASD Specification (AISI, 1986), the LRFD 
                 Specification (AISI, 1991), the 1996 Specification and the Specification (AISI, 2001, 2007, 2012, 
                 and 2014) between 2001 and 2016 editions are compared in Figures C-E2-1, C-E2-2, and C-
                 E2-3. 
























                                                                                    
                      Figure C-E2-3 Comparison Between the Nominal Axial Strengths [Resistances], P n 
                Figure C       -E2-1 shows a comparison of the critical flexural buckling stresses used in the 
                 1986, 1991, 1996 and 2001 Specifications. No changes were made on critical flexural buckling 
                 stresses between the 2001 edition and the 2016 edition. Because of the use of a relatively 
                 smaller safety factor in the 1996 Specification (as well as in the Specifications to the 2016 
                 edition), it can be seen from Figure C-E2-2 that the design capacity is increased for thin 
                 columns with low slenderness parameters and decreased for high slenderness 
                 parameters. However, the differences would be less than 10 percent. For the LRFD 
                 method, the differences between the nominal axial strengths [resistances] used for the 1991,

                 LSD provisions would be the same as the curve for LRFD. 
              (d) Effective Length Factor, K 
                The effective length factor, K, accounts for the influence of restraint against rotation and 
                 translation at the ends of a column on its load-carrying capacity. For the simplest case, a 
                 column with both ends hinged and braced against lateral translation, buckling occurs in a 
                 single half-wave and the effective length KL, being the length of this half-wave, is equal to 
                 the actual physical length of the column (Figure C-E2-4); correspondingly, for this case, K 
                 = 1. This situation is approached if a given compression member is part of a structure 
                 which is braced in such a manner that no lateral translation (sidesway) of one end of the 
                 column relative to the other can occur. This is so for columns or studs in a structure with 
                 diagonal bracing, diaphragm bracing, shear-wall construction or any other provision 
                 which prevents horizontal displacement of the upper relative to the lower column ends. 
                 In these situations it is safe and only slightly, if at all, conservative to take K = 1. 

























                                                           
                                     Figure C-E2-4 Overall Column Buckling 
                If translation is prevented and abutting members (including foundations) at one or both 
                 ends of the member are rigidly connected to the column in a manner which provides 
                 substantial restraint against rotation, K-values smaller than 1 (one) are sometimes 
                 justified. Table C-E2-1 provides the theoretical K values for six idealized conditions in 
                 which joint rotation and translation are either fully realized or nonexistent. The same 
                 table also includes the K values recommended by the Structural Stability Research 
                 Council for design use (Galambos, 1998). 
                In trusses, the intersection of members provides rotational restraint to the compression 
                 members at service loads. As the collapse load is approached, the member stresses approach 
                 the yield stress, which greatly reduces the restraint they can provide. For this reason, K 
                 value is usually taken as unity regardless of whether they are welded, bolted, or 
                 connected by screws. However, when sheathing is attached directly to the top flange of a

                 continuous compression chord, research (Harper, LaBoube and Yu, 1995) has shown that 
                 the K values may be taken as 0.75 (AISI, 1995).

                On the other hand, when no lateral bracing against sidesway is present, such as in the 
                 portal frame of Figure C-E2-5, the structure depends on its own bending stiffness for 
                 lateral stability. In this case, when failure occurs by buckling of the columns, it invariably 
                 takes place by the sidesway motion shown. This occurs at a lower load than the columns

                 would be able to carry if they were braced against sidesway, and the figure shows that 
                 the half-wave length into which the columns buckle is longer than the actual column 
                 length. Hence, in this case K is larger than 1 (one) and its value can be read from the 
                 graph of Figure C-E2-6 (Winter et al., 1948a and Winter, 1970). Since column bases are 
                 rarely either actually hinged or completely fixed, K-values between the two curves should 
                 be estimated depending on actual base fixity. 
                Figure C-E2-6 can also serve as a guide for estimating K for other simple situations. For 
                 multi-bay and/or multi-story frames, simple alignment charts for determining K are 
                 given in the AISC Commentaries (AISC, 1989, 1999, 2005). For additional information on 
                 frame stability and second-order effects, see SSRC Guide to Stability Design Criteria for Metal 
                 Structures (Galambos, 1998) and the AISC Specifications and Commentaries. 
                If roof or floor slabs, anchored to shear walls or vertical plane bracing systems, are 
                 counted upon to provide lateral support for individual columns in a building system, 
                 their stiffness must be considered when functioning as horizontal diaphragms (Winter, 
                 1958a).

              C. Torsional Buckling of Columns 
                It was pointed out at the beginning of this section that purely torsional buckling, i.e., 
                 failure by sudden twist without concurrent bending, is also possible for certain cold-
                 formed open shapes. These are all point-symmetric shapes (in which shear center and 
                 centroid coincide), such as doubly-symmetric I-shapes, anti-symmetric Z-shapes, and 
                 such unusual sections as cruciforms, swastikas, and the like. Under concentric load, 
                 torsional buckling of such shapes very rarely governs design. This is so because such 
                 members of realistic slenderness will buckle flexurally or by a combination of flexural and 
                 local buckling at loads smaller than those which would produce torsional buckling. However, 
                 for relatively short members of this type, carefully dimensioned to minimize local 
                 buckling, such torsional buckling cannot be completely ruled out. If such buckling is elastic, 
                 it occurs at the critical stress, σt , calculated as follows (Winter, 1970):

                For inelastic buckling, the critical torsional buckling stress can also be calculated according 
                 to Equation C-E2-9 by using σt  as F e  in the calculation of λc . 
              D. Flexural-Torsional Buckling of Columns 
                As discussed previously, concentrically loaded columns can buckle in the flexural 
                 buckling mode by bending about one of the principal axes; or in the torsional buckling 
                 mode by twisting about the shear center; or in the flexural-torsional buckling mode by 
                 simultaneous bending and twisting. For singly-symmetric shapes such as channels, hat 
                 sections, angles, T-sections, and I-sections with unequal flanges, for which the shear center 
                 and centroid do not coincide, flexural-torsional buckling is one of the possible buckling 
                 modes as shown in Figure C-E2-7. Non-symmetric sections will always buckle in the 
                 flexural-torsional mode. 
                It should be emphasized that one needs to design for flexural-torsional buckling only 
                 when it is physically possible for such buckling to occur. This means that if a member is so 
                 connected to other parts of the structure, such as wall sheathing, that it can only bend but 
                 cannot twist, it needs to be designed for flexural buckling only. This may hold for the entire 
                 member or for individual parts. For instance, a channel member in a wall or the chord of 
                 a roof truss is easily connected to girts or purlins in a manner which prevents twisting at 
                 these connection points. In this case, flexural-torsional buckling needs to be checked only

                 for the unbraced lengths between such connections. Likewise, a doubly-symmetric 
                 compression member can be made up by connecting two spaced channels at intervals by 
                 batten plates. In this case, each channel constitutes an “intermittently fastened component 
                 of a built-up shape.” Here the entire member, being doubly-symmetric, is not subject to 
                 flexural-torsional buckling so that this mode needs to be checked only for the individual 
                 component channels between batten connections (Winter, 1970). 
                The governing elastic flexural-torsional buckling load of a column can be found from the 
                 following equation (Chajes and Winter, 1965; Chajes, Fang and Winter, 1966; Yu and 
                 LaBoube, 2010): 
                       1 P =     ( ) ( )       PPPPPP                    β4−+−+             2        n                                                              (C-E2-13)  2β                zxzx                       zx  
                If both sides of this equation are divided by the cross-sectional area A, one obtains the 
                 equation for the elastic, flexural-torsional buckling stress F cre  as follows: 
                        1 Fcre =    ( ) ( )          σβσ4−σ+σ−σ+σ                 2                                    (C-E2-14)  2β                 textex                        tex                                
                For this equation, as in all provisions which deal with flexural-torsional buckling, the x-
                 axis is the axis of symmetry; σex  = π2 E/(K x Lx /r x )2  is the flexural Euler buckling stress 
                 about the x-axis; σt  is the torsional buckling stress (Equation C-E2-12); and β=1-(x o /r o )2 . It is 
                 worth noting that the flexural-torsional buckling stress is always lower than the Euler stress 
                 σex  for flexural buckling about the symmetry axis. Hence, for these singly-symmetric 
                 sections, flexural buckling can only occur, if at all, about the y-axis, which is the principal 
                 axis perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. 
                For inelastic buckling, the critical flexural-torsional buckling stress can also be calculated by 
                 using Equation C-E2-9. 
                An inspection of Equation C-E2-14 will show that in order to calculate β and σt , it is 
                 necessary to determine x o  = distance between shear center and centroid, J = Saint-Venant 
                 torsion constant, and C w  = warping constant, in addition to several other, more familiar 
                 cross-sectional properties. Because of these complexities, the calculation of the flexural-
                 torsional buckling stress cannot be made as simple as that for flexural buckling. Formulas for 
                 typical C-sections, Z-sections, angle and hat sections are provided in Part I of the AISI 
                 Design Manual (AISI, 2013). 
              E. Additional Design Consideration for Angles 
                During the development of a unified approach to the design of cold-formed steel 
                 members, Peköz realized the possibility of a reduction in column strength due to initial 
                 sweep (out-of-straightness) of angle sections. Based on an evaluation of the available test 
                 results, an initial out-of-straightness of L/1000 was recommended by Peköz for the 
                 design of concentrically loaded compression angle members and beam-columns in the 
                 1986 edition of the AISI Specification. Those requirements were retained in Sections E3 and 
                 H1.2 of the Specification. A study conducted at the University of Sydney (Popovic, 
                 Hancock, and Rasmussen, 1999) indicated that for the design of singly-symmetric 
                 unstiffened angle sections under the axial compression load, the required additional 
                 moment about the minor principal axis due to initial sweep should only be applied to 
                 those angle sections subjected to local buckling at stress F y . Consequently, clarification was 
                 made in the 2001 edition of the AISI Specification, and is retained in Section H1.2 of this

                 edition.  
                Equations E2-1 to E2-3 have been shown to be conservative in predicting the 
                 experimental failure loads obtained from tests of concentrically loaded pin-ended and 
                 fixed-ended angle columns. Tested columns exhibit end supports fixed with respect to 
                 warping and major-axis flexure, but pinned or fixed with respect to minor-axis flexure. Tests 
                 were performed by Popovic, et al. (1999) and Chodraui, et al. (2006) for columns with minor-axis 
                 pin-ends, and by Popovic, et al. (1999) and Young (2004, 2005) for columns with fixed-ends. The 
                 above underestimation is essentially due to the fact that Equations E2-1 to E2-3: (1) account 
                 twice for the local/flexural-torsional effects (Rasmussen, 2005), and (2) disregard the beneficial 
                 effect of the warping fixity (Shifferaw and Schafer, 2014). Dinis et al. (2012) and Mesacasa, 
                 et al. (2014) investigated the mechanics of these phenomena and showed that the collapse of 
                 intermediate plain angle columns is governed by the interaction between major-axis 
                 flexural-torsional buckling (akin, but not identical, to local bucking) and minor-axis flexural 
                 buckling. Due to effective centroid shift effects (Young and Rasmussen, 1999), this interaction 
                 is much stronger in pin-ended columns. Several design methods/approaches have been 
                 proposed to estimate more accurately the angle column failure loads, thus accounting for 
                 the increased strength due to the warping fixity (e.g., Young, 2004; Rasmussen, 2005; 
                 Silvestre, et al., 2013; Shifferaw and Schafer, 2014; and Dinis and Camotim, 2015). Using 
                 flexural-torsional strength curves (instead of the local buckling strength curves), the research 
                 finding of angle end-fixity is valid for columns with pin-ends and fixed-ends, and provides 
                 reliable prediction of column failure loads. 
              F.  Slenderness Ratios 
                The slenderness ratio, KL/r, of all compression members should preferably not exceed 
                 200, except that during construction only, KL/r should not exceed 300. In 1999, the above 
                 recommendations were moved from the Specification to the Commentary. 
                The maximum slenderness ratios on compression and tension members have been 
                 stipulated in steel design standards for many years but are not mandatory in the AISI 
                 Specification. 
                The KL/r limit of 300 is still recommended for most tension members in order to control 
                 serviceability issues such as handling, sag and vibration. The limit is not mandatory, 
                 however, because there are a number of applications where it can be shown that such 
                 factors are not detrimental to the performance of the structure or assembly of which the 
                 member is a part. Flat strap tension bracing is a common example of an acceptable type of 
                 tension member where the KL/r limit of 300 is routinely exceeded. 
                The compression member KL/r limits are recommended not only to control handling, 
                 sag and vibration serviceability issues, but also to flag possible strength concerns. The 
                 AISI Specification provisions adequately predict the capacities of slender columns and 
                 beam-columns, but the resulting strengths are quite small and the members relatively 
                 inefficient. Slender members are also very sensitive to eccentrically applied axial load 
                 because the moment magnification factors given by 1/α will be large. 
             
              E2.1 Sections Not Subject to Torsional or Flexural-Torsional Buckling 

                 If concentrically loaded compression members can buckle in the flexural buckling mode by 
              bending about one of the principal axes, the nominal flexural buckling strength [resistance] of the 
              column without considering local buckling should be determined by using Equation E2-1 of 
              the Specification. The elastic flexural buckling stress is given in Equation E2.1-1 of the

              Specification, which is the same as Equation C-E2-3 of the Commentary. This provision is 
              applicable to doubly-symmetric sections, closed cross-sections and any other sections not 
              subject to torsional or flexural-torsional buckling. 
             
                E2.1.1 Closed-Box Section 

                   For the determination of the compression strength of members of Grade 80 (550) Class 
                3 steels produced to ASTM A653/A653M and A792/792M, compression tests of steel 
                produced to Australian Standard AS1397 G550 (which is similar to ASTM A792 Grade 80 
                (550) Class 3) were performed at the University of Sydney by Yang and Hancock (2004a, 
                2004b), and Yang, Hancock and Rasmussen (2004). For short-box sections where F n  = F y , 
                the study (Yang and Hancock, 2004a) shows that the limit of the yield stress used in design 
                can be 90 percent of the specified minimum yield stress, F sy , for low-ductility steels. For edge-
                stiffened elements with intermediate stiffener(s), stub compression testing on channel 
                sections (Yang and Hancock, 2004b) confirms the provisions given in Specification Section 
                1.4.2. For long column tests of channel sections (Yang and Hancock, 2004b), distortional 
                buckling as well as the interaction of local and distortional buckling controls the design. The 
                use of 0.9 F sy  in the distortional buckling equations produces reliable results. 
                   Further, for calculating the nominal strength [resistance] of concentrically loaded 
                compression members with a closed-box section, Specification Equations E2.1.1-1 and 
                E2.1.1-2, based on the University of Sydney research findings (Yang, Hancock and 
                Rasmussen, 2002), were added in the Specification Section E2.1.1 when determining the 
                nominal axial strength [resistance] according to Sections E2 and E3. The reduction factor R r  
                specified in Equation E2.1.1-2 is to be applied to the radius of gyration r and allows for the 
                interaction of local and flexural (Euler) buckling of thin high-strength low-ductility steel 
                sections. The reduction factor is a function of the length varying from 0.65 at KL = 0 to 1.0 
                at KL = 1.1L 0 , where L 0  is the length at which the local buckling stress equals the flexural 
                buckling stress. 
             
              E2.2 Doubly- or Singly-Symmetric Sections Subject to Torsional or Flexural-Torsional Buckling 

                 As discussed previously in Section E2, torsional buckling is one of the possible buckling 
              modes for doubly- and point-symmetric sections. For singly-symmetric sections, flexural-torsional 
              buckling is one of the possible buckling modes. The other possible buckling mode is flexural 
              buckling by bending about the y-axis (i.e., assuming x-axis is the axis of symmetry). 
                 For torsional buckling, the elastic buckling stress can be calculated by using Equation C-E2-
              12. For flexural-torsional buckling, Equation C-E2-14 can be used to compute the elastic buckling 
              stress. The following simplified equation for elastic flexural-torsional buckling stress is an 
              alternative permitted by the AISI Specification: 
                        σσF        extcre =                                                             (C-E2.2-1)  σ+σ   ext
                 The above equation is based on the following interaction relationship given by Peköz and 
              Winter (1969a): 
                 1   1   1+=                                                              (C-E2.2-2)  P        zxn  P   P

              E2.3 Point-Symmetric Sections  

                 This section of the Specification is for the design of discretely braced point-symmetric 
              sections subjected to axial compression. An example of a point-symmetric section is a lipped or 
              unlipped Z-section with equal flanges. The critical elastic buckling stress of point-symmetric 
              sections is the lesser of the two possible buckling modes, the elastic torsional buckling stress, σt , 
              as defined in Specification Equation E2.2-5 or the elastic flexural buckling stress about its minor 
              principal axis, as defined in Specification Equation E2.1-1. Figure C-C2.2.1-5 shows the 
              relationship of the principal axes to the x and y axes of a lipped Z-section. The elastic flexural 
              buckling stress should be calculated for axis 2. 
             
              E2.4 Non-Symmetric Sections 

                 For non-symmetric open shapes, the analysis for flexural-torsional buckling becomes 
              extremely tedious unless its need is sufficiently frequent to warrant computerization. For one 
              thing, instead of the quadratic equations, cubic equations have to be solved. For another, the 
              calculation of the required section properties, particularly C w , becomes quite complex. The 
              method of calculation is given in Parts I and V of the AISI Design Manual (AISI, 2013) and the 
              book by Yu and LaBoube (2010). Section E2.4 of the Specification states that calculations 
              according to Appendix 2 should be used or tests according to Section K2 should be made 
              when dealing with non-symmetric open shapes. 
             
              E2.5 Sections With Holes 

                 The global buckling load, P cre , for columns decreases when holes are present (Sarawit, 
              2003; Moen and Schafer, 2009a). A “weighted average” approach is provided in Appendix 2, 
              which modifies the section properties due to the existence of holes. Appendix 2 also provides 
              rational elastic buckling analysis methods that can be used to determine the elastic buckling 
              loads with the influence of the holes. 
                 Within the limitations of the hole size given in Appendix 1.1.1, the hole influence on the 
              global buckling stress is negligible when using the Effective Width Method; therefore, an 
              exception is provided to exclude these cases from the additional requirements of Appendix 2. 
             
            E3 Local Buckling Interacting With Yielding and Global Buckling 

               The discussion in Section E2 refers to members subject to global (flexural, flexural-torsional 
            and torsional) buckling, but made up of elements whose w/t ratios are small enough so that no 
            local buckling will occur. For shapes which are sufficiently thin, i.e., with w/t ratios sufficiently 
            large, local buckling can combine with global buckling. For this case, the effect of local buckling on 
            the global buckling strength can be handled by using the Effective Width Method, which applies 
            the effective area, A e , determined at the stress F n ; or the Direct Strength Method, which takes into 
            consideration the local and global buckling interaction in the strength predication equations. 
               The Effective Width Method’s approach to local buckling is to conceptualize the member as a 
            collection of “elements” and investigate local buckling of each element separately. 
               The Direct Strength Method provides a means to incorporate all relevant global buckling 
            modes into the design process. Further, all buckling modes are determined for the member as a

            whole rather than element by element. This ensures that compatibility and equilibrium are 
            maintained at element junctures. Consider, as an example, the lipped C-section shown in pure 
            compression in Figure C-2.2.2-2(a). The member’s local elastic buckling load from the analysis is: 
                Pcr  = 0.12 x 48.42 kips = 5.81 kips (25.84 kN) 
               The column has a gross area (A g ) of 0.881 in 2  (568.4 mm 2 ); therefore, 
                fcr  = P cr /A g  = 6.59 ksi (45.44 MPa) 
               The Effective Width Method determines a plate buckling coefficient, k, for each element, then 
            fcr , and finally the effective width. The centerline dimensions (ignoring corner radii) are h = 8.94 
            in. (227.1 mm), b = 2.44 in. (62.00 mm), d = 0.744 in. (18.88 mm), and t = 0.059 in. (1.499 mm), the 
            critical buckling stress, f cr , of each element as determined from the Appendix 1 of the 
            Specification: 
                lip:    k = 0.43,  f cr-lip = 0.43[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/d) 2  = 72.1 ksi (497 MPa) 
                flange:  k = 4,     f cr-flange = 4.0[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/b) 2  = 62.4 ksi (430 MPa) 
                web:   k = 4,     f cr-web = 4.0[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/h) 2  = 4.6 ksi (32.0 MPa) 
               Each element predicts a different buckling stress, even though the member is a connected 
            group. These differences in the buckling stress are ignored in the Effective Width Method. The high 
            flange and lip buckling stresses have little relevance given the low web buckling stress. The finite 
            strip analysis, which includes the interaction amongst the elements, shows that the flange aids 
            the web significantly in local buckling, increasing the web buckling stress from 4.6 ksi (32.0 MPa) to 
            6.59 ksi (45.4 MPa), but the buckling stress in the flange and lip are much reduced due to the same 
            interaction.  
               The Direct Strength Method is a robust method, but the Effective Width Method, which has 
            been used by design engineers for over two decades, also provides a comprehensive and 
            reliable design solution.    
             
              E3.1 Effective Width Method 

                 For cold-formed steel compression members with large w/t ratios, local buckling of 
              individual component plates may occur before the applied load reaches the nominal axial 
              strength [resistance] determined by Equation C-E2-7. The interaction effect of the local and 
              overall column buckling may result in a reduction of the overall column strength. From 1946 
              through 1986, the effect of local buckling on column strength was considered in the AISI 
              Specification by using a form factor, Q, in the determination of allowable stress for the design 
              of axially loaded compression members (Winter, 1970; Yu and LaBoube, 2010). Even though 
              the Q-factor method was used successfully for the design of cold-formed steel compression 
              members, research work conducted at Cornell University and other institutions has shown 
              that this method can be improved. On the basis of the test results and analytical studies of 
              DeWolf, Peköz, Winter, and Mulligan (DeWolf, Peköz and Winter, 1974; Mulligan and Peköz, 
              1984) and Peköz’s development of a unified approach for the design of cold-formed steel 
              members (Peköz, 1986b), the Q-factor method was eliminated in the 1986 edition of the AISI 
              Specification. In order to reflect the effect of local buckling on the reduction of column strength, 
              the nominal axial strength [resistance] is determined by the critical column buckling stress and 
              the effective area, A e , instead of the full sectional area. When A e  cannot be calculated, such as 
              when the compression member has dimensions or geometry beyond the range of 
              applicability of the AISI Specification, the effective area, A e , can be determined experimentally 
              by stub column tests using AISI S902, Stub-Column Test Method for Effective Area of Cold-Formed

              Steel Columns (AISI, 2013c). For a more in-depth discussion of the background for these 
              provisions, see Peköz (1986b). Therefore, the nominal axial strength [resistance] of cold-formed 
              steel compression members can be determined by the following equation: 
              Pn   = A e Fcr                                                              (C-E3-1) 
               where F cr  is either elastic buckling stress or inelastic buckling stress, whichever is applicable, 
               and A e  is the effective area at F cr . 
                 In the Effective Width Method, column nominal strength [resistance] is calculated by 
              multiplying the nominal column buckling stress, F n , by the effective area, A e , calculated at F n . 
              This accounts for local buckling reductions in the actual column strength (i.e., local-global 
              interaction). 
                 Research at the University of Sydney (Popovic, Hancock, and Rasmussen, 1999) has 
              shown that singly-symmetric unstiffened cold-formed steel angles, which have a fully 
              effective cross-section under yield stress, do not fail in a flexural-torsional mode and can be 
              designed based on flexural buckling alone as specified in Specification Section E2.1. There is also 
              no need to include a load eccentricity for these sections when using Specification Section H1.2 
              as explained in Item E of Section E2. 
             
                E3.1.1 Members Without Holes 

                  E3.1.1.1  Closed Cylindrical Tubular Sections 

                     Closed thin-walled cylindrical tubular members are economical sections for 
                  compression and torsional members because of their large ratio of radius of gyration to 
                  area, the same radius of gyration in all directions, and the large torsional rigidity. Like 
                  other cold-formed steel compression members, cylindrical tubes must be designed to 
                  provide adequate safety not only against overall column buckling but also against local 
                  buckling. It is well known that the classic theory of local buckling of longitudinally 
                  compressed cylinders overestimates the actual buckling strength, and that inevitable 
                  imperfections and residual stresses reduce the actual strength of compressed tubes 
                  radically below the theoretical value. For this reason, the design provisions for local 
                  buckling have been based largely on test results. 
                Local Buckling Stress 
                     Considering the post-buckling behavior of the axially compressed cylinder and the 
                  important effect of the initial imperfection, the design provisions included in the AISI 
                  Specification were originally based on Plantema’s graphic representation and the 
                  additional results of cylindrical shell tests made by Wilson and Newmark at the 
                  University of Illinois (Winter, 1970). 
                     From the tests of compressed tubes, Plantema found that the ratio F ult /F y  depends 
                  on the parameter (E/F y )(t/D), in which t is the wall thickness, D is the mean diameter of 
                  the tube, and F ult  is the ultimate stress or collapse stress. As shown in Figure C-E3.1.1.1-1, 
                  Line 1 corresponds to the collapse stress below the proportional limit, Line 2 corresponds 
                  to the collapse stress between the proportional limit and the yield stress, and Line 3 
                  represents the collapse stress occurring at yield stress. In the range of Line 3, local buckling 
                  will not occur before yielding. In Ranges 1 and 2, local buckling occurs before the yield 
                  stress is reached. The cylindrical tubes should be designed to safeguard against local 
                  buckling.

                     Based on a conservative approach, the Specification specifies that when the D/t ratio 
                  is smaller than or equal to 0.112E/F y , the tubular member shall be designed for yielding. 
                  This provision is based on point A 1 , for which (E/F y )(t/D) = 8.93. 
                     When 0.112E/F y  < D/t < 0.441E/F y , the design of tubular members is based on the 
                  inelastic local buckling criteria. For the purpose of developing a design equation for 
                  inelastic buckling, point B 1  was selected to represent the proportional limit. For point B 1 ,

                     When D/t ≥ 0.441E/F y , the following equation represents Line 1 for elastic local 
                  buckling stress:

                     The correlations between the available test data and Equations C-E3.1.1.1-2 and C-
                  E3.1.1.1-3 are shown in Figure C-E3.1.1.1-2. The definition of symbol “D” was changed 
                  from “mean diameter” to “outside diameter” in the 1986 AISI Specification in order to be 
                  consistent with the general practice.  
                     As indicated in Commentary Section F2.3, Specification Section E3.1.1.1 is only 
                  applicable to members having a ratio of outside diameter-to-wall thickness, D/t, not

                  elastic local buckling resulting in an uneconomical design. In addition, cylindrical tubular 
                  members with unusually large D/t ratios are very sensitive to geometric imperfections.

                                  Cylindrical Tubes Under Axial Compression 

                     When closed cylindrical tubes are used as concentrically loaded compression 
                  members, the nominal axial strength [resistance] is determined by the same equation as 
                  given in Specification Section E2, except that: (1) the nominal buckling stress, F e , is 
                  determined only for flexural buckling, and (2) the effective area, A e , is calculated by 
                  Equation C-E3.1.1.1-4: 
                              R1(1[A          2e             −−−=         )(      A/A1   o   )]A                                  (C-E3.1.1.1-4) 
                      where 
                      R  =       F2/F    ey                                                (C-E3.1.1.1-5) 

                                        

                      A   = area of the unreduced cross-section.  
                     Equation C-E3.1.1.1-6 is used for computing the reduced area due to local buckling. It 
                  is derived from Equation C-E3.1.1.1-2 for inelastic local buckling stress (Yu and LaBoube, 
                  2010). 
                     In 1999, the coefficient, R, was limited to one (1.0) so that the effective area, A e , will 
                  always be less than or equal to the unreduced cross-sectional area, A. To simplify the 
                  equations, R = F y /(2F e ) is used rather than R =  F     ey /(   )F2    as in the previous edition of 
                  the AISI Specification. The equation for the effective area is simplified to A e  = A o  + R(A - 
                  Ao ) as given in Equation E3.1.1.1-1 of the Specification.

                   For members with circular holes, the provisions in Appendix 1.1.1 (a) should be used in 
                determining the effective area, A e . The Specification permits ignoring the hole effect if the 
                effective length region times the hole diameter divided by the effective length does not exceed 
                0.015.  
             
              E3.2 Direct Strength Method 

                 In the Direct Strength Method, the local buckling is considered in two parts: the long column 
              strength without any reduction for local buckling (P ne ), and the long column strength 
              considering local-global interaction (P n ). The calibration of the Direct Strength Method has 
              been provided in Section E1. 
             
                E3.2.1 Members Without Holes 

                   The nominal strength [resistance] of compression members without holes is provided in 
                Specification Section E3.2.1 with the buckling load, P cre , determined in accordance with 
                Section E2. 
             
                E3.2.2 Members With Holes 

                   The Direct Strength Method (DSM) approach to columns with holes utilizes the elastic 
                buckling properties of a cold-formed steel column (P cr , P crd , and P cre ), including the 
                influence of holes (e.g., flat punched holes in studs, patterned holes in rack sections, holes 
                with edge stiffeners) to predict ultimate strength. In most cases, holes decrease the elastic 
                buckling properties, P cr , P crd , and P cre , which increases a column’s local (λ ), distortional 
                (λd ) and global (λc ) slenderness and lowers the predicted strength. Simplified methods for 
                predicting P cr , P crd , and P cre  including holes are presented in Appendix 2. Alternatively, 
                full finite element elastic Eigen-buckling analysis can be performed.  
                   The DSM strength prediction expressions have been modified to limit the maximum 
                strength of a column with holes to the capacity of the net cross-section, P ynet  (Moen and 
                Schafer, 2011). A transition from P ynet , through the inelastic regime, to the elastic buckling 
                portion of the distortional buckling strength curve has also been included in the design 
                provisions. The transition slope is dictated by the ratio of the net section capacity to gross 
                section capacity, P ynet /P y , which was derived based on observed trends in column 
                simulations to collapse, reported in Moen and Schafer (2009a). If a member contains mostly 
                holes, then the critical elastic buckling loads and the net section capacity approach zero. The 
                DSM strength equations are written such that when the net section goes to zero, predicted 
                capacity also degrades to zero. 
                   The development and calibration of the Direct Strength Method provisions for columns 
                with holes was performed with experimental and simulation databases as reported in 
                Moen and Schafer (2009a) and summarized in Moen and Schafer (2011). Note that both 
                databases contain only lipped Cee cross-sections with discrete web holes because this is 
                what was available in the research literature at the time. However, the philosophy of 
                employing elastic buckling parameters (P cr , P crd , P cre ) to predict the ultimate strength of 
                cold-formed steel columns with holes was thoroughly validated in Moen and Schafer 
                (2009a), and is assumed to hold true for other cross-section shapes and for members with

                E3.2.2 for compression members and Section F3.2.2 for flexural members. Hole influence 
                on strength can be counterintuitive and difficult to predict just with engineering judgment 
                alone. Therefore, the strength reduction should be calculated, even if the holes are small. 
                Rules of thumb on the influence of holes in both compression and flexural members are: (1) 
                rectangular or elongated holes typically reduce local buckling strength more than square 
                and circular holes; (2) web holes always decrease distortional buckling strength; (3) holes 
                always reduce global (Euler) buckling strength; (4) the more holes along a member, the 
                more the strength decreases; (5) hole patterns, such as those typically present in storage 
                rack columns, can reduce strength as much as discrete holes; and (6) adding edge stiffeners 
                to holes increases local buckling strength more than distortional buckling and global buckling 
                strength. 
                   In an approximate strength check, the influence of holes on unlapped compression or 
                flexural members can be ignored when the sum of the length of holes along the member is 
                less than or equal to 10 percent of the member length (Σ(L h /L)≤0.10); the maximum hole 
                depth (width) is greater than or equal to 25 percent of the hole length (d h /L h  ≥ 0.25); and 
                the net cross-sectional area is greater than or equal to 95 percent of the gross cross-sectional 
                area (A net /A g ≥0.95). Members meeting these limits are expected to have a capacity 
                reduction of 5 percent or less caused by the presence of holes. 
             
            E4 Distortional Buckling  

                 The expression selected for distortional buckling of columns is shown in Figure C-E1-1 and 
              Figure C-E1-2 and is discussed in Section E1. Based on experimental test data and on the 
              success of the Australian/New Zealand code (see Hancock et al., 2001 for discussion and 
              Hancock et al., 1994 for further details), the distortional buckling strength is limited to P y  
              instead of P ne . This presumes that distortional buckling failures are independent of long-
              column behavior, i.e., little if any distortional-global interaction exists. See Appendix 2 for 
              information on rational analysis methods for calculation of P crd . 
             
              E4.1 Members Without Holes 

                 Distortional buckling is an instability that may occur in members with edge-stiffened 
              flanges, such as lipped C- and Z-sections. As shown in Figure C-E4.1-1, this buckling mode is 
              characterized by instability of the entire flange, as the flange along with the edge stiffener 
              rotates about the junction of the flange and the web. The length of the buckling wave in 
              distortional buckling is considerably longer than local buckling, and noticeably shorter than 
              flexural or flexural-torsional buckling. The Specification provisions of Section 1.3 partially 
              account for distortional buckling, but research has shown that a separate limit state check is 
              required (Schafer, 2002). Thus, in 2007, treating distortional buckling as a separate limit state, 
              Specification Section E4.1 was added to address distortional buckling in columns and 
              Specification Section F4.1 was added to address distortional buckling in beams.  
                 Determination of the nominal strength [resistance] in distortional buckling (Specification 
              Equation E4.1-2) was validated by testing. Specification Equation E4.1-2 was originally 
              developed for the Direct Strength Method. Calibration of the safety and resistance factors for

              Specification Equation E4.1-2 is provided in Commentary Section E1. In addition, the 
              Australian/New Zealand Specification (AS/NZS 4600) has used an expression of similar 
              form to Specification Equation E4.1-2, but yielding slightly less conservative strength 
              predictions than Equation E4.1-2. 
                 Distortional buckling is unlikely to control the strength of a column if: (a) the web is slender 
              and triggers local buckling far in advance of distortional buckling, as is the case for many 
              common C-sections, (b) edge stiffeners are sufficiently stiff and thus stabilize the flange (as is 
              often the case for C-sections, but typically not for Z-sections due to the use of sloping lip 
              stiffeners), (c) unbraced lengths are long and flexural or flexural-torsional buckling strength 
              limits the capacity, or (d) adequate rotational restraint is provided to the flanges from 
              attachments (panels, sheathing, etc.).

                 The primary difficulty in calculating the strength in distortional buckling is to efficiently 
              estimate the elastic distortional buckling load, P crd . Recognizing the complexity of this 
              calculation, Appendix 2 provides two alternatives: (a) numerical solutions, or (b) analytical 
              formulas for C- and Z-section members and any open section with a single web and flanges of 
              the same dimension. See the Appendix 2 commentary for further discussion. The Appendix 2 
              commentary also provides a simplified analytical formula method that may be useful in 
              preliminary design, and was specifically derived as a conservative simplification to 
              Specification 2.3.1.3. 
             
              E4.2 Members With Holes 

                 Figure C-E4.2-1 compares the distortional buckling strength prediction curve for a column 
              without holes to the prediction curve for the same column with holes, where P ynet  = 0.80P y .

              For the column with holes, P nd  is limited to a maximum strength of P ynet . As distortional 
              slenderness increases, the prediction transitions from P ynet  to the same strength curve used 
              for columns without holes. The transition is implemented to reflect the change in failure 
              mode as slenderness increases, from yielding at the net section to elastic distortional buckling 
              along the column.  
                 The extension of the DSM approach to columns with holes utilizes the elastic buckling 
              properties of a cold-formed steel column (P cr , P crd , and P cre ), including the influence of holes 
              to predict ultimate strength. In most cases, holes decrease the elastic buckling properties, P cr , 
              Pcrd , and P cre , which increases a column’s local (λ), distortional (λ              d ) and global (λc ) 
              slenderness and lowers the predicted strength. Simplified methods for predicting P cr , P crd , 
              and P cre  including holes are presented in Appendix 2. Alternatively, full finite element elastic 
              Eigen-buckling analysis can be performed.  
                 The DSM strength prediction expressions have been modified to limit the maximum 
              strength of a column with holes to the capacity of the net cross-section, P ynet  (Moen and 
              Schafer, 2011). A transition from P ynet , through the inelastic regime, to the elastic buckling 
              portion of the distortional buckling strength curve has also been included in the design 
              provisions. The transition slope is dictated by the ratio of the net section capacity to gross 
              section capacity, P ynet /P y , which was derived based on observed trends in column 
              simulations to collapse, reported in Moen and Schafer (2009a). If a member contains mostly 
              holes, then the critical elastic buckling loads and the net section capacity approach zero. The 
              DSM strength equations are written such that when the net section goes to zero, predicted 
              capacity also degrades to zero.

            F. MEMBERS IN FLEXURE 
               This chapter provides the design requirements for flexural members.  
               In 2007, the design provisions related to metal roof and wall systems were moved to Section 
            I6:  
            (1) Flexural Members Having One Flange Through-Fastened to Deck or Sheathing,  
            (2) Flexural Members Having One Flange Fastened to a Standing Seam Roof System,  
            (3) Compression Members Having One Flange Through-Fastened to Deck or Sheathing, and 
            (4) Strength [Resistance] of Standing Seam Roof Panel Systems.  
               In 2016, the Specification was reorganized, moving the tension design provisions to Chapter 
            D, compression design provisions to Chapter E, shear design provisions to Chapter G, and the 
            combined load checks to Chapter H. Chapter F contains the flexural member design provisions 
            only. In addition, the Direct Strength Method and the Effective Width Method are combined. 
             
            F1 General Requirements 

               In general, a common nominal strength [resistance] equation is provided in the Specification for 
            a given limit state with a required safety factor (Ω) for Allowable Strength Design (ASD) and a 
            resistance factor (φ) for Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) or Limit States Design (LSD). 
            Design provisions that are applicable to a specific country are provided in the corresponding 
            lettered appendix. 
               The thin-walled nature of cold-formed beams complicates behavior and design. Elastic 
            buckling analysis reveals at least three buckling modes: local, distortional, and lateral-torsional 
            buckling (for members in strong-axis bending) that must be considered in design. Bending 
            strengths of flexural members are determined by considering yielding, global (lateral torsional) 
            buckling in Specification Section F2, local buckling interaction with global buckling in Specification 
            Section F3, and distortional buckling in Specification Section F4. The member flexural strength is 
            the least of the strengths after considering the above buckling modes.  
               Like column design, two approaches can be used in beam design: Effective Width Method 
            (EWM) and Direct Strength Method (DSM). The EWM traditionally addressed local and global 
            buckling. In 2004, the distortional buckling strength prediction using DSM was adopted.  
               In considering flexural member yielding and global buckling, the DSM follows the same 
            practice as the EWM. The Effective Width Method provides the lateral-torsional buckling strength in 
            terms of a stress, F n  (Specification Equation F2.1-1). In the DSM, this is converted from a stress to 
            a moment by multiplying by the gross section modulus, S f , resulting in Specification Equation 
            F2.1-1 for M ne.  The DSM emerged through the combination of more refined methods for local 
            and distortional buckling prediction, improved understanding of the post-buckling strength and 
            imperfection sensitivity in distortional buckling, and the relatively large amount of available 
            experimental data. 
               In the Effective Width Method, for beams that are not fully braced and locally unstable, beam 
            strength is calculated by multiplying the predicted stress for failure in lateral-torsional buckling, 
            Fn , by the effective section modulus, S e , determined at stress F n . This accounts for local buckling 
            reductions in the lateral-torsional buckling strength (i.e., local-global interaction). In the DSM, this 
            calculation is broken into two parts: the lateral-torsional buckling strength without any reduction 
            for local buckling (M ne ), and the strength considering local-global interaction (M n ).

               The strength curves for local and distortional buckling of a beam fully braced against lateral-
            torsional buckling are presented in Figure C-F1-1 and compared to the critical elastic buckling 
            curve. The post-buckling reserve for the local mode is predicted to be greater than that of the 
            distortional mode. As depicted in Figure C-F1-1, provisions were added in 2012 for inelastic 
            reserve capacity in bending, i.e., where M n  > M y .

               If members are laterally supported, then they are proportioned according to the nominal 
            section strength (Specification Section F3.1). Since distortional buckling has an intermediate 
            buckling half wavelength, distortional buckling still needs to be considered even for braced 
            members. See the Direct Strength Method Design Guide (AISI, 2006) for detailed discussion and 
            design examples. If they are laterally unbraced, then the limit state is lateral-torsional buckling and 
            possible interaction with local buckling (Specification Sections F2 and F3). 
               The extension of the DSM approach to beams with holes utilizes the elastic buckling 
            properties of a cold-formed steel beam (M cr , M crd , and M cre ) including the influence of holes to 
            predict ultimate strength. In most cases, holes decrease M cr , M crd , and M cre ; this increases the 
            beam’s local (λ), distortional (λd ) and global (λc ) slenderness and lowers the predicted strength.  
            Simplified methods for predicting M cr , M crd , and M cre  including holes are presented in 
            Appendix 2. Alternatively, full finite element elastic Eigen-buckling analysis can be performed.  
               The calibration of the Effective Width Method was reviewed in the Commentary of the 1991 
            edition of the Specification. A brief discussion of the DSM is provided herein. The reliability of 
            the DSM beam provisions was determined using test data defined by the limits of Section B4.1 
            and the provisions of Section K2 of the Specification. Based on a target reliability, β, of 2.5, a 
            resistance factor, φ, of 0.90 was calculated for all of the investigated beams. Based on this 
            information, the safety and resistance factors of Specification Chapter F were determined for the 
            prequalified members. The safety factor, Ω, is back-calculated from φ at an assumed dead-to-live 
            load ratio of 1 to 5. Since the range of prequalified members is relatively large, extensions of the 
            DSM to geometries outside the prequalified set are allowed. However, given the uncertain 
            nature of this extension, increased safety factors and reduced resistance factors are applied in that 
            case, per the rational engineering analysis provisions of Section A1.2(c) of the Specification. 
               The provisions of Specification Chapter F, applied to the beams of Specification Section B4.1, 
            are summarized in Figure C-F1-2. The controlling strength is determined either by Specification 
            Section F3, which considers local buckling interaction with lateral-torsional buckling, or by

            Specification Section F4, which considers the distortional mode alone. The controlling strength 
            (minimum predicted of the two modes) is highlighted for the examined members by the choice 
            of marker. Overall performance of the method can be judged by examination of Figure C-F1-2. 
            The scatter shown in the data is similar to that of the Effective Width Method. 
               The development and calibration of the DSM provisions for beams with holes were 
            performed with a simulation database as reported in Moen and Schafer (2009a) and a set of 12 
            beam experiments summarized in Moen, et al. (2012). Note that the simulations and 
            experiments only considered lipped Cee cross-sections with discrete web holes. However, the 
            philosophy of employing elastic buckling parameters (M cr , M crd , M cre ) to predict the ultimate 
            strength of cold-formed steel beams with holes, validated in Moen and Schafer (2009a), is 
            assumed to hold true for other cross-section shapes.  
               Resistance factors for beams with holes were calculated by limit state with Section K2 of the 
            main Specification. Based on a target reliability, β, of 2.5, the resistance factor, φ, was calculated

            buckling. For beams predicted to experience a distortional buckling failure mode, φ was calculated 
            with the simulation database as 0.91 and with the Moen, et al. (2012) experiments as 0.94. 
             
            F2 Yielding and Global (Lateral-Torsional) Buckling 

               The bending capacity of flexural members can be limited by yielding or the lateral-torsional 
            buckling strength of the member depending on the member’s lateral unbraced length. The 
            design provisions for determining the nominal lateral-torsional buckling strength [resistance] are 
            given in Specification Section F2. 
             
              F2.1 Initiation of Yielding Strength 

                 In this section, the limit states of yielding and global (lateral-torsional) buckling are 
              discussed. 
              A. Initiation of Yielding 
                 For compact beams with short unbraced lengths, the member may fail by yielding. The 
              yield moment is determined by Equation C-F2.1-1: 
                My   = S f Fy                                                          (C-F2.1-1) 
              where S f  is the unreduced elastic section modulus, and F y  is the yield stress. 
              B. Lateral-Torsional Buckling  
              (a) Elastic Buckling Stress for Doubly- or Singly-Symmetric Open Cross-Section 
                 If a doubly-symmetric or singly-symmetric member in bending is laterally unbraced, it 
              can fail in lateral-torsional buckling. For a beam having simply supported end conditions both 
              laterally and torsionally, the elastic critical lateral-torsional buckling stress can be determined by 
              Equation C-F2.1-2.

                 For other than simply supported end conditions, Equation C-F2.1-2 can be generalized as 
              given in Equation C-F2.1-2a (Galambos, 1998):

                 In the above equation, K y  and K t  are effective length factors; L y  and L t  are unbraced lengths 
              for bending about the y-axis and for twisting, respectively; E is the modulus of elasticity; G is 
              the shear modulus; S f  is the elastic section modulus of the full unreduced section relative to 
              the extreme compression fiber; I y  is the moment of inertia about the y-axis; C w  is the torsional 
              warping constant; J is the Saint-Venant torsion constant; and L is the unbraced length. 
                 For equal-flange I-members with simply supported end conditions both laterally and 
              torsionally, Equation C-F2.1-3 can be used to calculate the elastic critical buckling stress 
              (Winter, 1947a; Yu and LaBoube, 2010):

               In Equation C-F2.1-3, the first term under the square root represents the lateral bending 
            rigidity of the member, and the second term represents the Saint-Venant torsional rigidity. For 
            thin-walled cold-formed steel sections, the first term usually exceeds the second term by a 
            considerable margin. 
               For simply supported I-members with unequal flanges, the following equation has been 
            derived by Winter for the lateral-torsional buckling stress (Winter, 1943):

            where I yc  and I yt  are the moments of inertia of the compression and tension portions of the full 
            section, respectively, about the centroidal axis parallel to the web. Other symbols were defined 
            previously. For equal-flange sections, I yc  = I yt  = I y /2, Equations C-F2.1-3 and C-F2.1-4 are 
            identical. 
               For other than simply supported end conditions, Equation C-F2.1-4 can be generalized as 
            given in Equation C-F2.1-4a:

               In Equation C-F2.1-4a, the second term under the square root represents the Saint-Venant 
            torsional rigidity, which can be neglected without any loss in economy. Therefore, Equation C-
            F2.1-4a can be simplified as shown in Equation C-F2.1-5 by considering I y  = I yc  + I yt  and 
            neglecting the term 4GJ(K t Lt )2 /(π2 Iy Ed 2) :

               Equation C-F2.1-5 was derived on the basis of a uniform bending moment and is 
            conservative for other cases. For this reason, σcr  is modified by multiplying the right-hand side 
            by a bending coefficient, C b , to account for nonuniform bending and the symbol F e  is used for 
            σcr , i.e.,

               where C b  is the bending coefficient, which can conservatively be taken as unity, or 
            calculated in accordance with Equation C-F2.1-11. 
               In the 1986 edition of the Specification, in addition to the use of Equation C-F2.1-6 for 
            determining the critical stresses, more design equations (Specification Equations F2.1.1-1, F2.1.2-1, 
            and F2.1.3-1) for elastic critical stress were added as alternative methods. These additional 
            equations were developed from the previous studies conducted by Peköz, Winter and Celebi on 
            flexural-torsional buckling of thin-walled sections under eccentric loads (Peköz and Winter, 1969a; 
            Peköz and Celebi, 1969b) and are retained in this edition of the Specification. These general 
            design equations can be used for singly-, doubly- and point-symmetric sections. Consequently, the 
            elastic critical lateral-torsional buckling stress can be determined by the following equation: 
                  C ArFe =  b  o    σσS        tey                                                     (C-F2.1-7) 
                     f
               where σey  and σt  are the elastic buckling stresses as defined in Specification Equations F2.1.1-4 
            and F2.1.1-5, respectively. 
               In the 1996 edition of the Specification, this general form was adopted as the primary design 
            equation and Equation C-F2.1-6 was retained as an alternative. In the 2016 edition of the 
            Specification, the alternative equation was restricted to doubly-symmetric sections because it was 
            derived for I-members and was determined to be unconservative for most singly-symmetric 
            sections. 
            (b) Elastic Buckling Stress for Point-Symmetric Open Cross-Section 
               It should be noted that point-symmetric sections such as Z-sections with equal flanges will 
            buckle laterally at lower strengths than doubly- and singly-symmetric sections. A conservative 
            design approach is used in the Specification, in which the elastic critical buckling stress is taken to 
            be one-half of that for I-members. 
            (c) Elastic Buckling Stress for Closed Tubular Cross-Section 
               In computing the lateral-torsional buckling stress of closed-box sections, the warping constant, 
            Cw , may be neglected since the effect of nonuniform warping of box sections is small. The 
            critical buckling stress is

            nonuniform bending. C b  can be determined as follows: 
              Cb  = 1.75 + 1.05 (M 1 /M 2 ) + 0.3 (M 1 /M 2 )2  ≤ 2.3                             (C-F2.1-10) 
            in which M 1  is the smaller and M 2  the larger bending moment at the ends of the unbraced 
            length.  
               The above equation was used in the 1968, 1980, 1986, and 1991 editions of the Specification. 
            Because it is valid only for straight-line moment diagrams, Equation C-F2.1-10 was replaced by 
            the following equation for C b  in the 1996 edition of the Specification and is retained in this 
            edition of the Specification:

                where 
                Mmax  = Absolute value of maximum moment in the unbraced segment 
                MA    = Absolute value of moment at quarter point of unbraced segment 
                MB    = Absolute value of moment at centerline of unbraced segment 
                MC    = Absolute value of moment at three-quarter point of unbraced segment 
               Equation C-F2.1-11, derived from Kirby and Nethercot (1979), can be used for various 
            shapes of moment diagrams within the unbraced segment. It gives more accurate solutions for 
            fixed-end members in bending and moment diagrams which are not straight lines. This 
            equation is the same as that being used in the ANSI/AISC S360 (AISC, 2010a). 
               Figure C-F2.1-1 shows the differences between Equations C-F2.1-10 and C-F2.1-11 for a 
            straight line moment diagram.

               It should be noted that Equations C-F2.1-2a and C-F2.1-6 apply only to elastic buckling of 
            cold-formed steel members in bending when the computed theoretical buckling stress is less than 
            or equal to the proportional limit. When the computed stress exceeds the proportional limit, the

            beam behavior will be governed by inelastic buckling. The following equation was used for 
            calculating the critical moment in the 1986 edition of the AISI Specification: 
                            M    (M cr )I  =     1M            −    y

                                )M(4  cre 
            in which (M cr )e  is the elastic critical buckling moment.  
            The following equation for determining the inelastic buckling stress, F n , was adopted in the 1996 
            edition of the Specification: 
                  10         F         −=         y yn       1F                                                          (C-F2.1-13)  9       e 
            where F e  is the elastic critical lateral-torsional buckling stress. 
            The general shape of the curve as represented by Equation C-F2.1-13 is consistent with the 
            preceding edition of the Specification (AISI, 1986).  
               As specified in Specification Section F2.1, lateral-torsional buckling is considered to be elastic 
            up to a stress equal to 0.56F y . The inelastic region is defined by a Johnson parabola from 0.56F y  
            to (10/9)F y  at an unsupported length of zero. The (10/9) factor is based on the partial 
            plastification of the section in bending (Galambos, 1963). A flat plateau is created by limiting the 
            maximum stress to F y , which enables the calculation of the maximum unsupported length for 
            which there is no stress  reduction due to lateral-torsional instability. This maximum 
            unsupported length can be calculated by setting F y  equal to F n  in Equation C-F2.1-13. 
               This liberalization of the inelastic lateral-torsional buckling  curve for singly-,  
            doubly-, and point-symmetric sections has been confirmed by research in beam-columns (Peköz 
            and Sumer, 1992) and wall studs (Niu and Peköz, 1994). 
            (f) Limit of Unbraced Length 
               The elastic and inelastic critical stresses for the lateral-torsional buckling strength are shown in 
            Figure C-F2.1-2. For any unbraced length, L, less than L u , lateral-torsional buckling does not need 
            to be considered. L u  is determined by setting F cre  = 2.78F y  and L u  = L y  = L t . L u  may then be 
            calculated using the expression given below (AISI, 1996):

               For members with unbraced length, L ≤ L u , or elastic lateral-torsional buckling stress,  
            Fcre  ≥ 2.78F y , the flexural strength (without considering local buckling) is determined by 
            Specification Equation F2.1-1with F n  = F y . 
               Due to the high torsional stiffness of closed-box sections, lateral-torsional buckling is not 
            critical in typical design considerations, even for bending about the major axis. Deflection limits 
            will control most designs due to the large values of L u . However, lateral-torsional buckling can 
            control the design when the unbraced length is larger than L u , which is determined by setting 
            the inelastic buckling stress of Specification Equation F2.1-4 equal to F y , with F cre  set equal to 
            Specification Equation F2.1.4-2.

                 The hole effect was considered in determining the effective section modulus, S e , but was 
              not previously considered in global buckling analysis. The research work (Moen and Schafer, 
              2009a, 2009c and 2010b) indicated that the existence of holes will reduce the member global 
              buckling stress and lower the predicted strength. It was, therefore, decided that hole effect 
              should be considered in determining the global buckling stress. Specification Appendix 2 
              provides both analytical and numerical analysis methods to consider the hole effect.

                 Within the limitations of the hole size given in Appendix 1.1.3, the hole influence on the 
              lateral-torsional buckling stress is negligible when using the Effective Width Method; therefore, an 
              exception is provided to exclude these cases from the additional requirements of Appendix 2. 
             
              F2.3 Initiation of Yielding Strength [Resistance] for Closed Cylindrical Tubular Sections 

                 The discussion on cylindrical tubular member behavior and buckling modes is provided in 
              Commentary Section E3.1.1.1. It should be noted that the design provisions of Specification 
              Sections F2.3 and E3.1.1.1 are applicable only for members having a ratio of outside diameter-
              to-wall thickness, D/t, not greater than 0.441E/F y  because the design of extremely thin tubes 
              will be governed by elastic local buckling, resulting in an uneconomical design. In addition, 
              cylindrical tubular members with unusually large D/t ratios are very sensitive to geometric 
              imperfections. 
                 For thick cylinders in bending, the initiation of yielding does not represent a failure 
              condition as is generally assumed for axial loading. Failure is at the plastic moment capacity, 
              which is at least 1.29 times the moment at first yielding. In addition, the conditions for 
              inelastic local buckling are not as severe as in axial compression due to the stress gradient. 
                 Specification Equations F2.3-2, F2.3-3 and F2.3-4 are based upon the work reported by 
              Sherman (1985) and an assumed minimum shape factor of 1.25. This slight reduction in the 
              inelastic range has been made to limit the maximum bending stress to 0.75F y , a value 
              typically used for solid sections in bending for the ASD method. The reduction also brings 
              the criteria closer to a lower bound for inelastic local buckling. A small range of elastic local 
              buckling has been included so that the upper D/t limit of 0.441E/F y  is the same as for axial 
              compression.

                 All three equations for determining the nominal flexural strength [resistance] of closed 
              cylindrical tubular members are shown in Figure C-F2.3-1. These equations have been used in 
              the Specification since 1986 and are retained in this edition. In 1999, the limiting D/t ratios for 
              Specification Equations F2.3-2 and F2.3-3 were revised to provide an appropriate continuity. 
              The safety factor, Ωb , and the resistance factor, φb , are the same as used in Specification Section F2 
              for sectional bending strength. 
             
              F2.4 Inelastic Reserve Strength 

                F2.4.1 Element-Based Method 

                   Prior to 1980, the inelastic reserve capacity of beams was not included in the 
                Specification because most cold-formed steel shapes have large width-to-thickness ratios that 
                are considerably in excess of the limits required by plastic design. 
                   In the 1970s and early 1980s, research work on the inelastic strength of cold-formed 
                steel beams was carried out by Reck, Peköz, Winter, and Yener at Cornell University (Reck, 
                Peköz and Winter, 1975; Yener and Peköz, 1985a, 1985b). These studies showed that the 
                inelastic reserve strength of cold-formed steel beams due to partial plastification of the cross-
                section and the moment redistribution of statically indeterminate beams can be significant 
                for certain practical shapes. With proper care, this reserve strength can be utilized to 
                achieve more economical design of such members. 
                   In order to utilize the available inelastic reserve strength [factored resistance] of certain cold-
                formed steel beams, design provisions based on the partial plastification of the cross-
                section were added in the 1980 edition of the Specification. The same provisions are retained 
                in this edition of the Specification. According to Section F2.4.1 of the Specification, the 
                nominal section strength [resistance], M n , of those beams satisfying certain specific limitations 
                can be determined on the basis of the inelastic reserve capacity with a limit of 1.25M y , 
                where M y  is the effective yield moment. The ratio of M n /M y  represents the inelastic reserve 
                strength of a beam cross-section. 
                   The nominal moment [resistance], M n , is the maximum bending capacity of the beam by 
                considering the inelastic reserve strength through partial plastification of the cross-section. 
                The inelastic stress distribution in the cross-section depends on the maximum strain in the 
                compression flange, εcu . Based on the Cornell research work on hat sections having 
                stiffened compression flanges (Reck, Peköz and Winter, 1975), the AISI design provision 
                limits the maximum compression strain to be C y εy , where C y  is a compression strain factor 
                determined by using the equations provided in Specification Section F2.4.1 (a) as shown in 
                Figure C-F2.4.1-1. 
                   On the basis of the maximum compression strain, εcu , allowed in the Specification, the 
                neutral axis can be located by using Equation C-F2.4.1-1 and the nominal moment 
                [resistance] M n  can be determined by using Equation C-F2.4.1-2:  
                    ∫ σdA  = 0                                                      (C-F2.4.1-1) 
                    ∫ σydA = M n                                                    (C-F2.4.1-2) 
                   where σ is the stress in the cross-section, and y is the distance measured from the 
                   neutral axis to the yield stress.

                   The calculation of M n  based on inelastic reserve capacity is illustrated in Part I of the 
                AISI Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013) and the textbook by Yu and LaBoube 
                (2010). 
                   In 2001, the shear force upper limit was clarified. The stress upper limit is 0.35F y  for 
                ASD and 0.6F y  for LRFD and LSD in the Specification. 
                   Additional equations were provided in Specification Section F2.4.1(b) since 2004 for 
                determining the nominal moment strength [resistance], M n , based on inelastic reserve 
                capacity, for sections containing unstiffened compression elements under stress gradient. 
                Based on research by Bambach and Rasmussen (2002b, 2002c) on I- and plain channel 
                sections in minor axis bending, a compression strain factor, C y , determines the maximum 
                compressive strain on the unstiffened element of the section. The C y  values are dependent 
                on the stress ratio, ψ, and slenderness ratio, λ, of the unstiffened element, determined in 
                accordance with Section 1.2.2(a) of the Specification. 
             
                F2.4.2 Direct Strength Method 

                   In 2012, provisions were added (Specification Sections F2.4.2, F3.2.3, and F4.3) to take 
                advantage of the inelastic reserve strength for members that are stable enough to allow 
                partial plastification of the cross-section. Such sections have capacities in excess of M y  and 
                potentially as high as M p  (though practically, this upper limit is rarely achievable). As 
                Figure C-F1-1 shows, the inelastic reserve capacity is assumed to linearly increase with 
                decreasing slenderness.  
             
            F3 Local Buckling Interacting With Yielding and Global Buckling 

              F3.1 Effective Width Method 

                 For locally unstable beams, the interaction of the local buckling of the compression 
              elements and overall lateral-torsional buckling of members may result in a reduction of the 
              lateral-torsional buckling strength of the member. The effect of local buckling on the critical

              moment is considered by Equation F3.1-1 of the Specification by using the elastic section 
              modulus, S e , based on an effective section. 
                 Using the nominal lateral-torsional buckling strength [resistance] determined in accordance 
              with Specification Equation F3.1-1 with a resistance factor of φb  = 0.90, the reliability indexes of 
              β vary from 2.4 to 3.8 for the LRFD method. 
                 For locally stable beams, the nominal moment, M n , of the cross-section is the effective 
              yield moment, M y , determined on the basis of the effective areas of flanges and the beam web. 
              The effective width of the compression flange and the effective depth of the web can be 
              computed from the design equations given in Appendix 1 of the Specification.  
                 Similar to the design of hot-rolled steel shapes, the yield moment, M y , of a cold-formed 
              steel beam is defined as the moment at which an outer fiber (tension, compression, or both) 
              first attains the yield stress of the steel. This is the maximum bending capacity to be used in 
              elastic design. Figure C-F3.1-1 shows several types of stress distributions for yield moment 
              based on different locations of the neutral axis. For balanced sections (Figure C-F3.1-1(a)), the 
              outer fibers in the compression and tension flanges reach the yield stress at the same time. 
              However, if the neutral axis is eccentrically located, as shown in Figures C-F3.1-1(b) and (c), 
              the initial yielding takes place in the tension flange for case (b) and in the compression flange 
              for case (c).

                 Accordingly, the nominal section strength [resistance] for initiation of yielding is calculated by 
              using Equation C-F3.1-1: 
              Mn   = S e  F y                                                           (C-F3.1-1) 
                where 
                Fy   = Design yield stress 
                Se   = Elastic section modulus of the effective section calculated with the extreme 
                    compression or tension fiber at F y . 
               For cold-formed steel design, S e  is usually computed by using one of the following two 
            cases: 
            1.  If the neutral axis is closer to the tension than to the compression flange, the maximum stress 
               occurs in the compression flange, and therefore the plate slenderness ratio λ and the effective 
               width of the compression flange are determined by the w/t ratio and f = F y . Of course, this 
               procedure is also applicable to those beams for which the neutral axis is located at the mid-
               depth of the section. 
            2.  If the neutral axis is closer to the compression than to the tension flange, the maximum stress 
               of F y  occurs in the tension flange. The stress in the compression flange depends on the 
               location of the neutral axis, which is determined by the effective area of the section. The latter 
               cannot be determined unless the compressive stress is known. The closed-form solution of 
               this type of design is possible but would be a very tedious and complex procedure. It is 
               therefore customary to determine the sectional properties of the section by successive 
               approximation. 
               Prior to the 2008 edition of the AISI Specification, the design flexural strength [factored 
            resistance], φb Mn , employed different φb  factors depending on the compression flange. Based on 
            the 1991 edition of the Specification and the work of Hsiao, Yu and Galambos (1988a), 
            unstiffened flanges were specified at φb = 0.90 and edge-stiffened or stiffened flanges at φb  = 0.95 
            (ASD used one Ω factor for all cases). Examination of more recently available test data (Schafer 
            and Trestain, 2002; Yu and Schafer, 2003) and consideration of the fact that the higher φb  existed 
            in part due to inelastic reserve strength, which is already addressed in Specification Section

            with the φb  factors adopted in 2007 for the Specification, when the member is fully effective.

               The research work (Ellifritt, Sputo, and Haynes, 1992) and the study of Kavanagh and 
            Ellifritt (1993 and 1994) have shown that a discretely braced beam, not attached to deck and 
            sheathing, may fail either by lateral-torsional buckling between braces, or by distortional buckling 
            at or near the braced point. See Section F4 for commentary on distortional buckling strength. 
               The problems discussed above dealt with the type of lateral-torsional buckling of I-members, 
            C-sections, and Z-shaped sections for which the entire cross-section rotates and deflects in the 
            lateral direction as a unit. But this is not the case for U-shaped beams and the combined sheet-
            stiffener sections as shown in Figure C-F3.1-2. For this case, when the section is loaded in such a 
            manner that the brims and the flanges of stiffeners are in compression, the tension flange of the 
            beam remains straight and does not displace laterally. However, when the distortional buckling 
            may occur, the compression flange tends to buckle separately in the lateral direction, 
            accompanied by out-of-plane bending of the web, as shown in Figure C-F3.1-3. This distortional 
            buckling strength can be determined using the design provisions provided in Specification 
            Section F4. It should, however, be noted that for laterally unstable U-shaped beams, lateral-
            torsional buckling may still occur. Therefore, lateral-torsional buckling should still be considered 
            for U-shaped members.

                   The nominal strength [resistance] due to local buckling interacting with yielding or global 
                buckling is determined by Specification Equation F3.1-1, in which the effective section 
                modulus, S e , is calculated at the extreme F n . 
             
                F3.1.2 Members With Holes 

                   For members with holes, the elements beside the holes are considered as unstiffened 
                elements. The effective widths are then determined in accordance with Appendix 1 of the 
                Specification. The nominal stress, F n , should consider the effects of the holes in accordance 
                with Specification Section F2.2. 
             
                F3.1.3 Members Considering Inelastic Reserve Strength 

                   Specification Section F2.4.1 should be used for determining the inelastic reserve 
                strength, as applicable. The discussion of inelastic reserve strength has been provided in 
                Commentary Section F2.4.1. 
             
              F3.2 Direct Strength Method 

                 In the Direct Strength Method (DSM), local buckling is considered through beam lateral-
              torsional buckling without any reduction for local buckling (M ne ), and beam strength is 
              considered in local-global interaction (M n ). The calibration of the DSM for beams was 
              discussed in Commentary Section F1.

                F3.2.1 Members Without Holes 

                   The expression selected for local buckling of beams is shown in Figures C-F1-1 and C-F1-
                2 and is discussed in Section F1. The use of the DSM for local buckling and the development 
                of the empirical strength expression are given in Schafer and Peköz (1998). The potential 
                for local-global interaction is presumed; thus, the beam strength in local buckling is limited 
                to a maximum of the nominal lateral-torsional buckling strength [resistance], M ne . For fully 
                braced beams, the maximum M ne  value is the yield moment, M y .  
             
                F3.2.2 Members With Holes 

                   For beams with holes (e.g., flat-punched holes in studs, patterned holes in rack 
                sections, holes with edge stiffeners), M n  is limited to M ynet  to reflect yielding and collapse 
                of the net section when both local and global slenderness are low. 
                   More discussions are provided in Commentary Section E3.2.2 regarding hole influences 
                on member strength, including the treatment of stiffened holes (Grey and Moen, 2011; 
                Moen and Yu, 2010). 
             
                F3.2.3 Members Considering Local Inelastic Reserve Strength 

                   Unique expressions were derived for inelastic bending reserve in local buckling. This 
                reserve is only allowed in cross-sections that are predicted to have inelastic bending 
                reserve in lateral-torsional buckling (i.e., M ne  > M y ). The compressive strain which the cross-
                section may sustain in local bucking, C y εy , is shown to increase as specified in Specification 
                Equation F3.2.3-4 in both back-calculated strains from tested sections and average 
                membrane strains from finite element models (Shifferaw and Schafer, 2010). Local strains 
                in the corners and at the surface of the plates (comprising the cross-section) as they 
                undergo bending may be significantly in excess of C y εy  (Shifferaw and Schafer, 2010). As 
                a result, and consistent with the main Specification, C y  is limited to 3. 
                   For sections with first yield in tension, the potential for inelastic reserve capacity is 
                great, but the design calculations are more complicated. Specification Equation F2.4.2-1 only 
                applies after the cross-section begins to yield in compression, i.e., when the moment 
                reaches M yc . Calculation of M yc  requires the use of basic mechanics to determine the 
                moment strength in the partially plastified cross-section. M y  may be used in place of M yc , 
                but this is conservative (excessively so if the tensile strain demands are much higher than 
                the compressive strain demands). Based on experience and past practice, it has also been 
                determined that the tensile strain should not exceed three times the yield strain; thus the 
                moment is also limited by this value, i.e., M yt3 . 
                   Note: The slenderness λ  utilizes M y , instead of M ne , for simplicity in the inelastic 
                reserve regime and provides continuity with the expressions of Specification Section F3.2.1. 
                Further, the elastic buckling moment, M cr , is determined based on the elastic bending stress 
                distribution, not the plastic stress distribution. These simplifications were shown to be 
                sufficiently accurate when compared with existing tests and a parametric study using 
                rigorous nonlinear finite element analysis (Shifferaw and Schafer, 2010).

            F4 Distortional Buckling 

              F4.1 Members Without Holes 

                 Distortional buckling is an instability that may occur in members with edge-stiffened 
              flanges, such as lipped C- and Z-sections. As shown in Figure C-F4.1-1, this buckling mode is 
              characterized by instability of the entire flange, as the flange along with the edge stiffener 
              rotates about the junction of the compression flange and the web. The length of the buckling 
              wave in distortional buckling is considerably longer than local buckling, and noticeably shorter 
              than lateral-torsional buckling. The Specification provisions of Section 1.3 partially account for 
              distortional buckling, but research has shown that a separate limit state check is required 
              (Ellifritt, Sputo, and Haynes, 1992; Hancock, Rogers, and Schuster, 1996; Kavanagh and 
              Ellifritt, 1994; Schafer and Peköz, 1999; Hancock, 1997; Yu and Schafer, 2003 and 2006). Thus, 
              in 2007, provisions were added to address distortional buckling as a separate limit state.

                          Showing Local, Distortional, and Lateral-Torsional Buckling Modes 

                 Determination of the nominal strength [resistance] in distortional buckling (Specification 
              Equation F4.1-2) was validated by testing. Results of one such study (Yu and Schafer, 2006) 
              are shown in Figure C-F4.1-2. In addition, the Australian/New Zealand Specification 
              (AS/NZS 4600) has used Specification Equation F4.1-2 since 1996. Calibration of the safety and 
              resistance factors for Specification Equation F4.1-2 is provided in Commentary Section F1. 
                 Distortional buckling is unlikely to control the strength if: (a) edge stiffeners are sufficiently 
              stiff and thus stabilize the flange (as is often the case for C-sections, but typically not for Z-
              sections due to the use of sloping lips), (b) unbraced lengths are long and lateral-torsional 
              buckling strength limits the capacity, or (c) adequate rotational restraint is provided to the 
              compression flange from attachments (panels, sheathing, etc.).

                 The primary difficulty in calculating the strength in distortional buckling is to efficiently 
              estimate the elastic distortional buckling moment, M crd . Recognizing the complexity of this 
              calculation, Appendix 2 provides two alternatives:(a) numerical solutions, or (b) analytical 
              formula for C- and Z-section members and any open section with a single web and single 
              edge-stiffened compression flange. See the Appendix 2 commentary for further discussion. 
              The Appendix 2 commentary also provides a simplified analytical formula that may be useful 
              in preliminary design, and was specifically derived as a conservative simplification to 
              Specification Section 2.3.3.3. 
                  
              F4.2 Members With Holes 

                 The DSM strength prediction expressions have been modified to limit the maximum 
              strength of a beam with holes to the capacity of the net cross-section, M ynet  (Moen and 
              Schafer, 2009b). A transition from M ynet , through the inelastic regime, to the elastic buckling 
              portion of the distortional buckling strength curve is also included in the design provisions as 
              shown in Figure C-F4.2-1. The transition slope is dictated by the ratio of net section capacity 
              to gross section capacity, M ynet /M y , which was derived based on observed trends in beam 
              simulations to collapse reported in Moen and Schafer (2009b) and experiments (Moen et al., 
              2012).

                 The inelastic reserve strength provisions were added in 2012 based on the research 
              finding by Shifferaw and Schafer (2010). See commentary in Section F3.2.3 for detailed 
              discussion. The provisions take advantage of the inelastic reserve strength for members that 
              are stable enough to allow partial plastification of the cross-section. Such sections have 
              capacities in excess of M y  and potentially as high as M p  (though practically, this upper limit 
              is rarely achievable). As Figure C-F1-1 shows, the inelastic reserve capacity is assumed to 
              linearly increase with decreasing slenderness. 
             
            F5 Stiffeners 

              F5.1 Bearing Stiffeners 

                 Design requirements for attached bearing stiffeners (previously called transverse 
              stiffeners) were added in the 1980 Specification and the same design equations are retained in 
              Section F5 of the current Specification. The term “transverse stiffener” was changed to 
              “bearing stiffeners” in 2004. The nominal strength [resistance] equation given in Item (a) of 
              Specification Section F5.1 serves to prevent end crushing of the bearing stiffeners, while the 
              nominal strength [resistance] equation given in Item (b) is to prevent column-type buckling of 
              the web-stiffeners. The equations for computing the effective areas (A b  and A c ) and the effective 
              widths (b 1  and b 2 ) were adopted from Nguyen and Yu (1978a) with minor modifications. 
                 The available experimental data on cold-formed steel bearing stiffeners were evaluated 
              by Hsiao, Yu and Galambos (1988a). A total of 61 tests were examined. The resistance factor of 
              0.85 used for the LRFD method was selected on the basis of the statistical data. The 
              corresponding reliability indices vary from 3.32 to 3.41.

                 In 1999, the upper limit of w/t s  ratio for the unstiffened elements of cold-formed steel 
              bearing stiffeners was revised from 0.37   FE    to 0.42       for the reason that the former  ys         FE ys
              was calculated based on the Allowable Strength Design approach, while the latter is based on 
              the effective area approach. The revision provided the same basis for the stiffened and 
              unstiffened elements of cold-formed steel bearing stiffeners. 
             
              F5.2 Bearing Stiffeners in C-Section Flexural Members 

                 The provisions of this section are based on the research by Fox and Schuster (2001), which 
              investigated the behavior of stud and track type bearing stiffeners in cold-formed steel C-
              section flexural members. These stiffeners fall outside of the scope of Specification Section 
              F5.1. The research program investigated bearing stiffeners subjected to two-flange loading at 
              both interior and end locations, and with the stiffener positioned between the member flanges 
              and on the back of the member. A total of 263 tests were carried out on different stiffened C-
              section assemblies. The design expression in Specification Section F5.2 is a simplified method 
              applicable with the limits of the test program. A more detailed beam-column design method 
              is described in Fox (2002). 
             
              F5.3 Nonconforming Stiffeners  

                 Tests on rolled-in stiffeners covered in Specification Section F5.3 were not conducted in the 
              experimental program reported by Nguyen and Yu (1978). Lacking reliable information, the 
              available strength [factored resistance] of stiffeners should be determined by special tests.

            G. MEMBERS IN SHEAR AND WEB CRIPPLING 
            G1 General Requirements 

               Chapter G defines the shear strength of flexural members with or without web holes. The 
            design of transverse web stiffeners and the determination of web crippling strength are also 
            treated.  
             
            G2 Shear Strength [Resistance] of Webs Without Holes  

               Previous editions of the AISI ASD Specification (AISI, 1986) used three different safety factors 
            when evaluating the allowable shear strength of an unreinforced web because it was intended to 
            use the same nominal strength [resistance] equations for the AISI and AISC Specifications. To 
            simplify the design of shear using only one safety factor for ASD and one resistance factor for 
            LRFD, Craig (1999) carried out a calibration using the data by LaBoube and Yu (LaBoube, 
            1978a). Based on this work, the constant used in Specification Equation G2.1-5 was reduced from 
            0.64 to 0.60. In addition, the ASD safety factor for yielding, elastic and inelastic buckling is now 
            taken as 1.60, with a corresponding resistance factor of 0.95 for LRFD and 0.80 for LSD. 
             
              G2.1 Flexural Members Without Transverse Web Stiffeners 

                 The shear strength of flexural member webs is governed by either yielding or buckling, 
              depending on the h/t ratio and the mechanical properties of steel. For flexural member webs 
              having small h/t ratios, the nominal shear strength [resistance] is governed by shear yielding, 
              i.e., 
                    AV             ywywn       =t=       Α             htF60.03F    ≈/        y                                       (C-G2.1-1) 

              in which A w  is the area of the flexural member web computed as (ht), and t y  is the yield stress 
              of steel in shear, computed as  y   3/F     . 

                 For flexural member webs having large h/t ratios, the nominal shear strength [resistance] is 
              governed by elastic shear buckling (Yu and LaBoube, 2010), i.e., 
                                  EAk π2
                    AV                   wvwn =   tcr =                                                      (C-G2.1-2) 
                                µ−12(1        22 )(h )/t
              in which t cr  is the critical shear buckling stress in the elastic range, k v  is the shear buckling 
              coefficient, E is the modulus of elasticity, µ is the Poisson’s ratio, h is the web depth, and t is 
              the web thickness. By using µ = 0.3, the nominal shear strength [resistance], V n , can be determined 
              as follows: 

                               h/tEk904.0V           3n =      v                                                     (C-G2.1-3) 
                 For flexural member webs having moderate h/t ratios, the nominal shear strength 
              [resistance] is based on inelastic shear buckling (Yu and LaBoube, 2010), i.e., 
                              EFkt64.0V      2n =         yv                                                    (C-G2.1-4) 

                 The Specification provisions are applicable for the design of webs of flexural members and 
              decks either with or without transverse web stiffeners. 
                 The nominal strength [resistance] equations given in C-G2.1-1 to C-G2.1-4 above are similar 
              to the nominal shear strength [resistance] equations given in the AISI LRFD Specification (AISI, 
              1991). The acceptance of these nominal strength [resistance] equations for cold-formed steel

              sections has been considered in the study summarized by LaBoube and Yu (1978a). 
                 In 2016, the Direct Strength Method (DSM) equations for determining the nominal shear 
              strength [resistance] were adopted for sections prequalified to Specification Table B4.1-1, 
              including flat webs and webs with small intermediate longitudinal stiffeners. The DSM 
              equations provided in Specification Section G2.1 for shear are based on the nominal strength 
              [resistance] Equations C-G2.1-1 to C-G2.1-4. Validation for the local buckling equations in DSM 
              format has been confirmed (Pham and Hancock, 2012a) by tests on high-strength steel C-
              sections in shear, and combined bending and shear, and the tests of LaBoube and Yu (1978a).  
             
              G2.2 Flexural Members With Transverse Web Stiffeners 

                 The Pham and Hancock tests show that considerable tension field action is available for 
              local buckling if the web is fully restrained at the loading and support points over its full depth 
              by bolted connections. This post-local buckling has been included in the Specification Equations 
              G2.2-1 and G2.2-2 for aspect ratios up to 2:1 based on testing and FEM analyses (Pham and 
              Hancock, 2012b). These equations allow elastic local critical shear buckling force, V cr , to be 
              determined by an elastic buckling analysis of the whole section or web in pure shear including 
              longitudinal intermediate stiffeners. Experimental justification for inclusion of small 
              longitudinal intermediate stiffeners in the value of V cr  in Specification Equations G2.2-1 and 
              G2.2-2 is given in Pham and Hancock (2012a). Distortional buckling in shear has been ignored 
              at this stage. 
                 Prior to 2016, the shear strength with transverse web stiffeners was predicted using 
              Equations C-G2.1-1 to C-G2.1-4 while the transverse stiffener effect was considered in shear 
              buckling coefficient k v . Tension field action was, however, not considered. 
             
              G2.3 Web Elastic Critical Shear Buckling Force, V cr  

                 Specification Section G2.3 provides a simple analytical solution for shear buckling force, 
              Vcr , of an unreinforced web. However, for prequalified webs according to Specification Table 
              B4.1-1, a numerical analysis approach should be considered in accordance with Appendix 2, 
              which provides for the contribution of the transverse stiffeners in buckling analysis. 
             
            G3 Shear Strength of C-Section Webs With Holes 

               For C-section webs with holes, Schuster, et al. (1995) and Shan, et al. (1994) investigated the 
            degradation in web shear strength due to the presence of a web perforation. The test program 
            considered a constant shear distribution across the perforation, and included d 0 /h ratios 
            ranging from 0.20 to 0.78, and h/t ratios of 91 to 168. Schuster’s equation for reduction factor, 
            qs , was developed with due consideration for the potential range of both punched and field-cut 
            holes. Three-hole geometries—rectangular with corner fillets, circular, and diamond—were 
            considered in the test program. Eiler (1997) extended the work of Schuster and Shan for the case 
            of constant shear along the longitudinal axis of the perforation. He also studied linearly varying 
            shear, but this case is not included in the Specification. The development of Eiler’s reduction 
            factor, q s , utilized the test data of both Schuster, et al. (1995) and Shan, et al. (1994). The focus of 
            the test programs was on the behavior of slender webs with holes. Thus, for stocky web elements 
            with         Ek0.96h/t≤         yv /F , an anomaly exists; the calculated available shear strength [factored 
            resistance] is independent of t when h is constant. In this region, the calculated available shear 
            strength [factored resistance] is valid but may be somewhat conservative.

               The provisions for circular and non-circular holes also apply to any hole pattern that fits 
            within an equivalent virtual hole. Figure C-1.1.3-1 illustrates the L h  and d h  that may be used for 
            a multiple hole pattern that fits within a non-circular virtual hole. Figure C-1.1.3-2 illustrates the 
            dh  that may be used for a rectangular hole that fits within a circular virtual hole. For each case, 
            the design provisions apply to the geometry of the virtual hole geometry, not to the actual hole 
            or holes. The reduction factor, q s , only applies when the shear buckling stress, V cr , is computed 
            according to Section G2.3. 
             
            G4 Transverse Web Stiffeners 

              G4.1 Conforming Transverse Web Stiffeners 

                 The requirements for transverse web stiffeners included in Specification Section G4.1 were 
              primarily adopted from the AISC Specification (1978). The equations for determining the 
              minimum required moment of inertia (Specification Equation G4.1-1) and the minimum 
              required gross area (Specification Equation G4.1-2) of attached transverse web stiffeners are 
              based on the studies summarized by Nguyen and Yu (1978a). In Specification Equation G4.1-1, 
              the minimum value of (h/50) 4  was selected from the AISC Specification (AISC, 1978). 
                 For the LRFD method, the available experimental data on the shear strength of beam webs 
              with transverse web stiffeners were calibrated by Hsiao, Yu and Galambos (1988a). The 
              statistical data used for determining the resistance factor were summarized in the AISI Design 
              Manual (AISI, 1991). Based on these data, the reliability index was found to be 4.10 for 
              φ = 0.90. 
             
              G4.2 Nonconforming Transverse Web Stiffeners 

                 Tests on rolled-in transverse web stiffeners covered in Specification Section G4.2 were not 
              conducted in the experimental program reported by Nguyen and Yu (1978). Lacking reliable 
              information, the available strength [factored resistance] of stiffeners should be determined by 
              special tests, or rational engineering analysis. 
             
            G5 Web Crippling Strength of Webs Without Holes 

               Since cold-formed steel flexural members generally have large web slenderness ratios, the 
            webs of such members may cripple due to the high local intensity of the load or reaction. Figure 
            C-G5-1 shows typical web crippling failure modes of unreinforced single hat sections (Figure C-
            G5-1(a)) and of I-sections (Figure C-G5-1(b)) unfastened to the support. 
               In the past, the buckling problem of plates and the web crippling behavior of cold-formed steel 
            members under locally distributed edge loading have been studied by numerous investigators 
            (Yu and LaBoube, 2010). It has been found that the theoretical analysis of web crippling for cold-
            formed steel flexural members is rather complicated because it involves the following factors: 
            (1) nonuniform stress distribution under the applied load and adjacent portions of the web, (2) 
            elastic and inelastic stability of the web element, (3) local yielding in the immediate region of load 
            application, (4) bending produced by eccentric load (or reaction) when it is applied on the 
            bearing flange at a distance beyond the curved transition of the web, (5) initial out-of-plane 
            imperfection of plate elements, (6) various edge restraints provided by beam flanges and 
            interaction between flange and web elements, and (7) inclined webs for decks and panels.

            extensive experimental investigations conducted at Cornell University by Winter and Pian 
            (1946) and Zetlin (1955a); at the University of Missouri-Rolla by Hetrakul and Yu (1978 and 
            1979), Yu (1981), Santaputra (1986), Santaputra, Parks and Yu (1989), Bhakta, LaBoube and Yu

            and Hancock (1998). In these experimental investigations, the web crippling tests were carried 
            out under the following four loading conditions for beams having single unreinforced webs and 
            I-beams, single hat sections and multi-web deck sections: 
            1.  End one-flange (EOF) loading 
            2.  Interior one-flange (IOF) loading 
            3.  End two-flange (ETF) loading  
            4.  Interior two-flange (ITF) loading

               All loading conditions are illustrated in Figure C-G5-2. In Figures (a) and (b), the distances 
            between bearing plates were kept to no less than 1.5 times the web depth in order to avoid the 
            two-flange loading action. Application of the various load cases is shown in Figure C-G5-3 and 
            the assumed reaction or load distributions are illustrated in Figure C-G5-4. 
               In the 1996 edition of the AISI Specification, and in previous editions, different web crippling 
            equations were used for the various loading conditions stated above. These equations were 
            based on experimental evidence (Winter, 1970; Hetrakul and Yu, 1978) and the assumed 
            distributions of loads or reactions acting on the web as shown in Figure C-G5-4. The equations 
            were also based on the type of section geometry, i.e., shapes having single webs and I-sections 
            (made of two channels connected back-to-back, by welding two angles to a channel, or by 
            connecting three channels). C-and Z-sections, single hat sections and multi-web deck sections 
            were considered in the single web member category. I-sections made of two channels connected 
            back-to-back by a line of connectors near each flange or similar sections that provide a high 
            degree of restraint against rotation of the web were treated separately. In addition, different 
            equations were used for sections with stiffened or partially stiffened flanges and sections with 
            unstiffened flanges.

               Prabakaran (1993) and Prabakaran and Schuster (1998) developed one consistent unified web 
            crippling equation with variable coefficients (Specification Equation G5-1). These coefficients 
            accommodate one- or two-flange loading for both end and interior loading conditions of various 
            section geometries. Beshara (1999) extended the work of Prabakaran and Schuster (1998) by 
            developing new web crippling coefficients using the available data as summarized by Beshara 
            and Schuster (2000). The web crippling coefficients are summarized in Tables G5-1 to G5-5 of the 
            Specification and the parametric limitations given are based on the experimental data that was 
            used in the development of the web crippling coefficients. From Specification Equation G5-1, it can 
            be seen that the nominal web crippling strength [resistance] of cold-formed steel members depends 
            on an overall web crippling coefficient, C; the web thickness, t; the yield stress, F y ; the web 
            inclination angle, θ; the inside bend radius coefficient, C R ; the inside bend radius ratio, R/t; the 
            bearing length coefficient, C N ; the bearing length ratio, N/t; the web slenderness coefficient, C h ; 
            and the web slenderness ratio, h/t. 
               This new equation is presented in a normalized format and is nondimensional, allowing for 
            any consistent system of measurement to be used. Consideration was given to whether or not 
            the test specimens were fastened to the bearing plate/support during testing. It was discovered 
            that some of the test specimens in the literature were not fastened to the bearing plate/support 
            during testing, which can make a considerable difference in the web crippling capacity of certain 
            sections and loading conditions. Therefore, it was decided to separate the data on the basis of 
            members being fastened to the bearing plate/support and those not being fastened to the 
            bearing plate/support. The fastened-to-the-bearing plate/support data in the literature were 
            primarily based on specimens being bolted to the bearing plate/support; hence, a few control 
            tests were carried out by Schuster, the results of which are contained in Beshara (1999), using 
            self-drilling screws to establish the web crippling integrity in comparison to the bolted data. 
            Based on these tests, the specimens with self-drilling screws performed equally well in 
            comparison to the specimens with bolts. Fastened-to-the-bearing plate/support in practice can 
            be achieved by either using bolts, self-drilling/self-tapping screws or by welding. What is 
            important is that the flange elements are restrained from rotating at the location of load 
            application. In fact, in most cases, the flanges are frequently completely restrained against 
            rotation by some type of sheathing material that is attached to the flanges. 
               The data was further separated in the Specification based on section type, as follows: 
            1)  Built-up sections (Table G5-1), 
            2)  Single web channel and C-sections (Table G5-2), 
            3)  Single web Z-sections (Table G5-3),  
            4)  Single hat sections (Table G5-4), and  
            5) Multi-web deck sections (Table G5-5). 
               Calibrations were carried out by Beshara and Schuster (2000) in accordance with 
            Supornsilaphachai, Galambos and Yu (1979) to establish the safety factors, Ω, and the resistance 
            factors, φ, for each web crippling case. Based on these calibrations, different safety factors and 
            corresponding resistance factors are presented in the web crippling coefficient tables for the 
            particular load case and section type. In 2005, the safety and the resistance factors for built-up and 
            single hat sections with interior one-flange loading case were revised based on a more consistent 
            calibration. For the fastened built-up sections, the factors were revised from 1.65 to 1.75 (for 
            ASD), 0.90 to 0.85 (for LRFD) and 0.80 to 0.75 (for LSD). For the fastened single hat section, the 
            factors were revised from 1.90 to 1.80 (for ASD) and 0.80 to 0.85 (for LRFD). For the unfastened

            single hat sections, the factors were revised from 1.70 to 1.80 (for ASD), 0.90 to 0.80 (for LRFD) 
            and 0.75 to 0.70 (for LSD). Also in 2005, the coefficients for built-up sections were revised to 
            remove inconsistencies between unfastened and fastened conditions and to better reflect the 
            calibration for the safety factor and the resistance factors. Also, a minimum bearing length of 3/4 
            in. (19 mm) was introduced based on the data used in the development of the web crippling 
            coefficients. For fastened-to-support single web C- and Z-section members under interior two-
            flange loading or reaction, the distance from the edge of bearing to the end of the member 
            (Figure C-G5-2(d)) must be extended at least 2.5h. This requirement is necessary because a total 
            of 5h specimen length was used for the test setup shown in Figure C-G5-2(d) (Beshara, 1999). 
            The 2.5h length is conservatively taken from the edge of bearing rather than the centerline of 
            bearing. 
               The assumed distributions of loads or reactions acting on the web of a member, as shown in 
            Figure C-G5-4, are independent of the flexural response of the member. Due to the flexural 
            action, the point of bearing will vary relative to the plane of bearing, resulting in a nonuniform 
            bearing load distribution on the web. The value of P n  will vary because of a transition from the 
            interior one-flange loading (Figure C-G5-4(b)) to the end one-flange loading (Figure C-G5-4(a)) 
            condition. These discrete conditions represent the experimental basis on which the design 
            provisions were founded (Winter, 1970; Hetrakul and Yu, 1978). Based on additional updated 
            calibrations, the resistance factor for Canada LSD for the unfastened interior one-flange loading 
            (IOF) case in Specification Table G5-4 was changed from 0.75 to 0.70 in 2004. 
               In the case of unfastened built-up members such as I-sections (not fastened to the bearing 
            plate/support), the available data was for specimens that were fastened together with a row of 
            fasteners near each flange line of the member (Winter and Pian, 1946) and Hetrakul and Yu 
            (1978) as shown in Figure C-G5-5(a). For the fastened built-up member data of I-sections 
            (fastened to the bearing plate/support), the specimens were fastened together with two rows of 
            fasteners located symmetrically near the centerline length of the member, as shown in Figure C-
            G5-5(b) (Bhakta, LaBoube and Yu, 1992).

               In Specification Table G5-1, the heading was changed in 2012 to indicate that the resulting 
            nominal web crippling strength [resistance] is per web. 
               The research indicates that a Z-section having its end support flange bolted to the section’s 
            supporting member through two 1/2-in. (12.7-mm) diameter bolts will experience an increase 
            in end one-flange web crippling capacity (Bhakta, LaBoube and Yu, 1992; Cain, LaBoube and Yu, 
            1995). The increase in load-carrying capacity was shown to range from 27 to 55 percent for the

            sections under the limitations prescribed in the Specification. A lower-bound value of 30 percent 
            increase was permitted in Specification Section G5 of the 1996 Specification. This is now 
            incorporated under “Fastened to Support” condition. 
               In 2005, the R/t limit in Specification Table G5-3 regarding interior one-flange loading for 
            fastened Z-sections was changed from 5 to 5.5 to achieve consistency with Specification Equation 
            H3-3, which stipulates a limit of R/t = 5.5.  
               For two nested Z-sections, the 1996 Specification permitted the use of a slightly different 
            safety factor and resistance factor for the interior one-flange loading condition. This is no longer 
            required since the new web crippling approach now takes this into account in Specification Table 
            G5-3 of the Specification under the category of “Fastened to Support” for the interior one-flange 
            loading case. 
               The coefficients in Specification Table G5-4 for one-flange loading or reaction with fastened to 
            support condition are based on those with unfastened to support condition. For consistency, the 
            R/t ratios for unfastened to support condition were revised in 2009 to be the same as the values 
            of fastened to support condition. The table heading was changed to indicate that the resulting 
            nominal web crippling strength [resistance] is per web. 
               The previous web crippling coefficients in Table G5-5 for end one-flange loading (EOF) of 
            multi-web deck sections in the design provisions (AISI 2001) were based on limited data. This 
            data was based on specimens that were not fastened to the support during testing; hence, the 
            previous coefficients for this case were also being used conservatively for the case of fastened to 
            the support. Based on extensive testing, web crippling coefficients were developed by James A. 
            Wallace (2003) for both the unfastened and fastened cases of EOF loading. Calibrations were 
            also carried out to establish the respective safety factors and resistance factors. The R/t ratio for 
            interior one-flange loading with fastened to support condition was revised in 2012 to be 
            consistent with the corresponding interior one-flange loading value of the unfastened condition. 
            The heading of Table G5-5 was changed to indicate that the resulting nominal web crippling 
            strength [resistance] is per web. A note was also added to the table to indicate that multi-web deck 
            sections are considered unfastened for any support fastener spacing greater than 18 in. (460 
            mm) (Wallace, 2004). 
               In 2004, the definitions of “one-flange loading” and “two-flange loading” were revised 
            according to the test setup, specimen lengths, development of web crippling coefficients, and 
            calibration of safety factors and resistance factors. In Figures C-G5-3 and C-G5-4 of the 
            Commentary, the distances from the edge of bearing to the end of the member were revised to be 
            consistent with the Specification. 
               Specification Equation G5-2 for single web C- and Z-sections with an overhang or overhangs 
            is based on a study of the behavior and resultant failure loads from an end one-flange loading 
            investigation performed at the University of Missouri-Rolla (Holesapple and LaBoube, 2002). 
            This equation is applicable within the limits of the investigation. The UMR test results indicated 
            that in some situations with overhangs, the interior one-flange loading capacity may not be 
            achieved, and the interior one-flange loading condition was therefore removed from Figures C-
            G5-3 and C-G5-4. 
               Tests were conducted on fastened to support, stiffened flange, single web 3-½ in. (88.9 mm) 
            C-sections subjected to interior two-flange loading or reactions (ITF) that indicate the web 
            crippling equation is unconservative by about 25 percent. Therefore, in 2012, the application of 
            the web crippling equation was limited to a web depth greater than or equal to 4-½ in. (110 mm) 
            or more to be consistent with the tests conducted by Schuster and Bashera in 1999. This revision

            was based on the web crippling test observations (Yu, 2009 and 2009a). 
             
            G6 Web Crippling Strength of C-Section Webs With Holes 

               Studies by Langan, et al. (1994), Uphoff (1996) and Deshmukh (1996) quantified the 
            reduction in web crippling capacity when a hole is present in a web element. These studies 
            investigated both the end one-flange and interior one-flange loading conditions for h/t and d h /h 
            ratios as large as 200 and 0.81, respectively. The studies revealed that the reduction in web 
            crippling strength is influenced primarily by the size of the hole as reflected in the d h /h ratio 
            and the location of the hole, x/h ratio. 
               The provisions for circular and non-circular holes also apply to any hole pattern that fits 
            within an equivalent virtual hole. Figure C-1.1.3-1 illustrates the L h  and d h  that may be used for 
            a multiple hole pattern that fits within a non-circular virtual hole. Figure C-1.1.3-2 illustrates the 
            dh  that may be used for a rectangular hole that fits within a circular virtual hole. For each case, 
            the design provisions apply to the geometry of the virtual hole geometry, not the actual hole or 
            holes.

            H.  MEMBERS UNDER COMBINED FORCES 
            H1 Combined Axial Load and Bending  

               In the 1996 edition of the AISI Specification, the design provisions for combined axial load 
            and bending were expanded to include expressions for the design of members subjected to 
            combined tensile axial load and bending. Since the 2001 edition, combined axial and bending for 
            the Limit States Design (LSD) method has been added. The design approach of the LSD method 
            is the same as the LRFD method. 
             
              H1.1 Combined Tensile Axial Load and Bending 

                 These provisions apply to concurrent bending and tensile axial load. If bending can occur 
              without the presence of tensile axial load, the member must also conform to the provisions of 
              Specification Chapters E, F, Sections I4, I6.1, and I6.2. Care must be taken not to overestimate 
              the tensile load, as this could be unconservative. 
                 Specification Equation H1.1-1 provides a design criterion to prevent yielding of the tension 
              flange of a member under combined tensile axial load and bending. Therefore, the available 
              flexural strengths [factored resistances], M axt  and M ayt , are calculated based on the section 
              modulus of full unreduced section relative to the extreme tension fiber. Specification Equation 
              H1.1-2 provides a design criterion to prevent failure of the compression flange. 
             
              H1.2 Combined Compressive Axial Load and Bending 

                 Cold-formed steel members under a combination of compressive axial load and bending 
              are usually referred to as beam-columns. The bending may result from eccentric loading, 
              transverse loads, or applied moments. Such members are often found in framed structures, 
              trusses, and exterior wall studs. For the design of such members, interaction equations have 
              been developed for locally stable and unstable beam-columns on the basis of thorough 
              comparison with rigorous theory and verified by the available test results (Peköz, 1986a; 
              Peköz and Sumer, 1992).  
                 The structural behavior of beam-columns depends on the shape and dimensions of the 
              cross-section, the location of the applied eccentric load, the column length, the end restraint, 
              and the condition of bracing. 
                 In 2007, the Specification introduced the second-order analysis, which contained the direct 
              analysis method approach as an optional method for structural stability analysis. In 2016, the 
              Specification was reorganized and it provides three methods of design for system stability: the 
              direct analysis method using rigorous second-order elastic analysis (Section C1.1), the direct 
              analysis method using amplified first-order elastic analysis (Section C1.2) and the effective 
              length method (Section C1.3). Since moment magnifications are considered in the system 
              analysis in accordance with Specification Section C1, Section H1.2 was revised accordingly by 
              deleting the terms relating to moment amplification (1/α) and moment gradient (C m ) as 
              these effects are now handled in Chapter C. 
                 When a beam-column is subjected to an axial load  P and end moments  M as shown in 
              Figure C-H1.2-1(a), the combined axial and bending stress in compression is given in 
              Equation C-H1.2-1 as long as the member remains straight:

                 In the design of a beam-column by using the ASD, LRFD or LSD method, the combined 
              stress should be limited by certain available stress F a ; that is,

                 As specified in Sections F2 and F3, I6.1, I6.2 and Chapter E of the Specification, the safety 
              factor or resistance factor for the design of compression members is different from the safety 
              factor or resistance factor for beam design. Therefore, Equation C-H1.2-2 may be modified as 
              follows:

                   If the strength ratio is used instead of the stress ratio, Equation C-H1.2-3 can be 
                rewritten as follows: 
                  P   M  1.0≤+                                                           (C-H1.2-4)  P    aa  M

                    Ma   = Available flexural strength [factored resistance] determined in accordance with 
                          Chapter F and Sections I6.1 and I6.2, as applicable 
                   Equation C-H1.2-4 is a well-known interaction equation which has been adopted in 
                several specifications for the design of beam-columns. It can be used with reasonable 
                accuracy for short members and members subjected to a relatively small axial load. It 
                should be realized that in practical applications, when end moments are applied to the 
                member, it will be bent as shown in Figure C-H1.2-1(b) due to the applied moment,  M , 
                and the secondary moment resulting from the applied axial load, P , and the deflection of 
                the member. This is why the increase of moment in the member due to member 
                deformation (P-δ effect), and story sway (P-∆ effect), as well as initial imperfections, need to 
                be considered in determining member forces. See Section C1 Commentary for further 
                information. 
                   In 2016, the Specification relaxed the requirement that the bending moment ( M ) should 
                be defined with respect to the centroidal axis of the effective section. The increased 
                eccentricity due to local buckling may exist in an ideally simply-supported member; it 
                becomes minor in continuous members or members with ends restrained so as to reduce 
                such eccentricity. Further, the Direct Strength Method utilized in Chapter F for the available 
                flexural strength [factored resistance], M a , has shown that accurate bending strength may be 
                determined without consideration of neutral axis shift. In such an approach, the designer 
                does not calculate effective properties or effective axes, and thus it is consistent to remove 
                such a requirement from the beam-column interaction check. Research indicates that use of 
                the gross centroidal axes is adequate for cold-formed steel beam-columns (Torabian, et al. 
                2013, 2014), and additional work is ongoing. 
                   For the design of angle sections using the ASD, LRFD or LSD method, the required 
                additional bending moment of PL/1000 about the minor principal axis is discussed in Item 
                E of Chapter E of the Commentary. 
             
            H2 Combined Bending and Shear 

               For cantilever beams and continuous beams, high bending stresses often combine with high 
            shear stresses at the supports. Such beam webs must be safeguarded against buckling due to the 
            combination of bending and shear stresses. 
               For disjointed flat rectangular plates, the critical combination of bending and shear stresses 
            can be approximated by the following interaction equation (Bleich, 1952), which is part of a unit 
            circle:

            bending, t is the actual shear stress, and tcr  is the theoretical buckling stress in pure shear. The 
            above equation was found to be conservative for beam webs with adequate shear stiffeners, for 
            which a diagonal tension field action may be developed. Based on the studies made by LaBoube 
            and Yu (1978b), Equation C-H2-3 was developed for beam webs with shear stiffeners satisfying 
            the requirements of Specification Section G4.

               Equation C-H2-3 was added to the AISI Specification in 1980. The correlations between 
            Equation C-H2-3 and the test results of beam webs having a diagonal tension field action are 
            shown in Figure C-H2-1. 
               Since 1986, the AISI Specification has used strength ratios (i.e., moment ratio for bending and 
            force ratio for shear) instead of stress ratios for the interaction equations. Specification Equations 
            H2-1 and H2-2 are based on Equations C-H2-2 and C-H2-3, respectively, by using the available

               The available flexural strength [factored resistance], M ao , for local buckling from Specification 
            Section F3.1 or F3.2 has been used in the interaction equations since combined bending and 
            shear occur in regions of high moment gradient where distortional buckling is unlikely to play a 
            significant role. Distortional buckling is checked independently in Specification Section F4.

            Validation of this approach has been confirmed from tests of lapped purlins (Pham and 
            Hancock, 2009b) and tests on high-strength steel C-sections in combined bending and shear 
            (Pham and Hancock, 2012a). However, where tension field action given by Specification 
            Equations G2.2-1 and G2.2-2 is used to compute V a , then flange distortion of unrestrained flanges 
            requires that distortional buckling be considered when computing M ao  (Pham and Hancock, 
            2012a). 
             
            H3 Combined Bending and Web Crippling  

               This Specification contains interaction equations for the combination of bending and web 
            crippling. Specification Equations H3-1 and H3-2 are based on an evaluation of available 
            experimental data using the web crippling equation included in the 2001 edition of the 
            Specification (LaBoube, Schuster, and Wallace, 2002). The experimental data is based on research 
            studies conducted at the University of Missouri-Rolla (Hetrakul and Yu, 1978 and 1980; Yu, 
            1981 and 2000), Cornell University (Winter and Pian, 1946), and the University of Sydney 
            (Young and Hancock, 2000). For embossed webs, crippling strength should be determined by 
            tests according to Specification Section K2. 
               The exception clause included in Specification Section H3 for single unreinforced webs 
            applies to the interior supports of continuous spans using decks and beams, as shown in Figure 
            C-H3-1. Results of continuous beam tests of steel decks (Yu, 1981) and several independent 
            studies by manufacturers indicate that, for these types of members, the post-buckling behavior 
            of webs at interior supports differs from the type of failure mode occurring under concentrated 
            loads on single-span beams. This post-buckling strength enables the member to redistribute the 
            moments in continuous spans. For this reason, Specification Equation H3-1 is not applicable to 
            the interaction between bending and the reaction at interior supports of continuous spans. This 
            exception clause applies only to the members shown in Figure C-H3-1 and similar situations 
            explicitly described in Specification Section H3. 
               The exception clause should be interpreted to mean that the effects of combined bending 
            and web crippling need not be checked for determining load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, the 
            positive bending resistance of the beam should be at least 90 percent of the negative bending

            resistance in order to ensure the safety implied by the Specification. 
               Using this procedure, the service loads may: (1) produce slight deformations in the member 
            over the support, (2) increase the actual compressive bending stresses over the support to as 
            high as 0.8 F y , and (3) result in additional bending deflection of up to 22 percent due to elastic 
            moment redistribution. 
               If load-carrying capacity is not the primary design concern because of the behavior described 
            above, the designer is urged to use Specification Equation H3-1. 
               In 1996, additional design information was added to Specification Section H3(c) for two 
            nested Z-shapes. These design provisions are based on the research conducted at the University 
            of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of Missouri-Rolla, and a metal building manufacturer 
            (LaBoube, Nunnery and Hodges, 1994). The web crippling and bending behavior of unreinforced 
            nested web elements is enhanced because of the interaction of the nested webs. The design 
            equation is based on the experimental results obtained from 14 nested web configurations. These 
            configurations are typically used by the metal building industry. 
               In 2003, based on the test data of LaBoube, Nunnery, and Hodges (1994), the interaction 
            equation for the combined effects of bending and web crippling was reevaluated because a new 
            web crippling equation was adopted for Section G5 of the Specification.  
               In the development of the original LRFD equations, a total of 551 tests were calibrated for 
            combined bending and web crippling strength. Based on φw  = 0.75 for single unreinforced webs 
            and φw  = 0.80 for I-sections, the values of the reliability index vary from 2.5 to 3.3 as 
            summarized in the AISI Commentary (AISI, 1991). 
             
            H4 Combined Bending and Torsional Loading 

               When the transverse loads applied to a bending member do not pass through the shear 
            center of the cross-section of the member, twisting and torsional stresses can develop. The 
            torsional stresses consist of pure torsional shear stresses, shear stresses due to warping, and 
            normal stresses due to warping. References, such as the AISC Steel Design Guide “Torsional 
            Analysis of Structural Steel Members” (AISC, 1997a), describe the effect of torsion and how 
            these stresses may be calculated.  
               Open cold-formed steel sections have little resistance to torsion, thus severe twisting and 
            large stresses can develop. In many situations, however, the connection between a beam and the 
            member delivering the load to the beam is such that it constrains twisting and in effect causes 
            the resultant load to act as though it is delivered through the shear center. In such cases the 
            torsional effects do not occur. Positive connections between the load-bearing flange and supported 
            elements, in general, prevent torsional effects. An example of this is a purlin supporting a 
            through-fastened roof panel that will prevent movement in the plane of the roof panel. It is 
            important that the designer ensure that torsion is adequately constrained when evaluating a 
            specific situation. 
               In situations where torsional loading cannot be avoided, discrete bracing will reduce the 
            torsional effects. For most situations, the maximum torsional warping stresses will occur at 
            discrete brace locations. Torsional bracing at the third points of the span would be adequate for 
            most light construction applications. The bracing should be designed to prevent torsional 
            twisting at the braced points. 
               Specification Section H4 provides design criteria for a singly- or doubly-symmetric member 
            that is subjected to torsional loading. The provision uses a reduction factor, R, to reduce the

            nominal moment strength [resistance] as determined by Specification Section F3 with F n  = F y  or  
            Mne  = M y . This factor accounts for the normal stresses due to combined torsional warping and 
            flexure. In 2012, the R factor was revised to accommodate situations where the maximum stress 
            due to combined bending and torsional warping occurs at the tip of the flange stiffener. This R 
            factor requires calculation of both the bending only stresses and the torsional warping stresses at 
            critical points on the cross-section. The largest combination of these is the denominator of the 
            reduction factor while the bending stress alone at the extreme fiber is the numerator. The 
            member is then selected based on bending alone with the effect of torsion accounted for by the 
            reduction in the nominal moment strength [resistance].  
               The largest combined stresses on the cross-section may occur at the junction of the web and 
            flange, at the junction of the edge of flange and flange stiffener, or at the tip of the flange stiffener. 
            The second and third conditions have a more severe effect on reducing the moment capacity of 
            the member. These conditions can occur when the applied load is positioned off the member 
            away from both the web and the shear center. This is shown from the test results reported in the 
            referenced paper by Put, et al. (1999). This is not a practical situation for structural assemblies; 
            however, this location of the critical stresses would occur at the position of a torsional brace 
            located at midspan of a member. To allow for the more favorable situation, the provisions of 
            Specification Section H4 permit the nominal moment strength [resistance] to be increased by 15 
            percent when the critical combination of stresses occurs at the junction of the flange and web. This 
            is supported by tests on channels conducted by Winter, et al. (1950), which indicated that an 
            overstress of 15 percent did not significantly affect the load-carrying capacity. 
               Rational engineering analysis should be used for sections, such as point-symmetric and non-
            symmetric sections, that are not covered by Specification Section H4. For these members, 
            combined flexural with torsional warping stresses should be checked at both maximum tensile 
            and compressive stress locations. A reasonable method would be to limit the combined bending 
            stress and torsional warping stress to an allowable stress or factored stress using safety factors or 
            resistance factors, respectively, provided in Specification F3, where F n  = F y  or M ne  = M y . Any 
            location on the cross-section that may control design should be considered. 
               The provisions of this section are intended as a separate limit state for available flexural 
            strength [factored resistance]. It is still necessary to check the other limit states listed in Specification 
            Sections F2 through F4, but those limit states are calculated without the torsional R factor. In 
            addition, the R factor is excluded from all interaction checks involving flexure such as combined 
            bending and shear (Specification Section H2), combined bending and web crippling (Specification 
            Section H3), and combined axial load and bending (Specification Section H1).

            I.  ASSEMBLIES AND SYSTEMS 
            I1 Built-Up Sections 
               I-sections made by connecting two C-sections back-to-back are one type of built-up section 
            that is often used as either flexural or compression members. Cases (2) and (8) of Figure C-A1.3-
            2 and Cases (3) and (7) of Figure C-A1.3-3 show several built-up I-sections. For built-up flexural 
            members, the Specification is limited to two back-to-back C-sections. For built-up compression 
            members, other sections can be used. 
             
              I1.1  Flexural Members Composed of Two Back-to-Back C-Sections 
                 For the I-sections to be used as flexural members, the longitudinal spacing of connectors 
              is limited by Equation I1.1-1 of the Specification. The first requirement is an arbitrarily selected 
              limit to prevent any possible excessive distortion of the top flange between connectors. The 
              second requirement is based on the strength and arrangement of connectors and the intensity 
              of the load acting on the beam (Yu and LaBoube, 2010).  
                 The second requirement for maximum spacing of connectors required by Specification 
              Equation I1.1-1 is based on the fact that the shear center of the C-section is neither coincident 
              with nor located in the plane of the web; and that when a load, Q, is applied in the plane of the 
              web, it produces a twisting moment, Qm, about its shear center, as shown in Figure C-I1.1-1. 
              The tensile force of the top connector, T s , can then be computed from the equality of the 
              twisting moment, Qm, and the resisting moment, T s g; that is: 
                  Qm = T s g                                                         (C-I1.1-1) 
                      Qm Ts  =                                                              (C-I1.1-2) g













                                                         
                      Figure C-I1.1-1 Tensile Force Developed in the Connector for C-Section 

                 Considering that q is the intensity of the load and that s is the spacing of connectors as 
              shown in Figure C-I1.1-2, the applied load is Q=qs/2. The maximum spacing, s max , used in 
              the Specification can easily be obtained by substituting the above value of Q into Equation C-
              I1.1-2 of this Commentary. The determination of the load intensity, q, is based upon the type of 
              loading applied to the beam. The requirement of three times the uniformly distributed load is 
              applied to reflect that the assumed uniform load will not really be uniform. The Specification 
              prescribes a conservative estimate of the applied loading to account for the likely 
              concentration of loads near the welds or other connectors that join the two C-sections.

              of connections, the spacing of connectors should not be so great as to cause excessive 
              distortion between connectors by separation along the top flange. In view of the fact that C-
              sections are connected back-to-back and are continuously in contact along the bottom flange, a 
              maximum spacing of L/3 may be used. Considering the possibility that one connection may 
              be defective, a maximum spacing of s max  = L/6 is the first requirement in Specification 
              Equation I1.1-1. 
             
              I1.2  Compression Members Composed of Two Sections in Contact 

                 Compression members composed of two shapes joined together at discrete points have a 
              reduced shear rigidity. The influence of this reduced shear rigidity on the buckling stress is 
              taken into account by modifying the slenderness ratio used to calculate the elastic critical 
              buckling stress (Bleich, 1952). The overall slenderness and the local slenderness between 
              connected points both influence the compressive resistance. The combined action is 
              expressed by the modified slenderness ratio given by the following: 
                              2    2 KL     KL     a      =     +                                               (C-I1.2-1)  r m    r      o  ri 
                 Note that in this expression, the overall slenderness ratio, (KL/r) o , is computed about the

              same axis as the modified slenderness ratio, (KL/r) m . Further, the modified slenderness ratio, 
              (KL/r) m , replaces KL/r in Specification Chapter E for both flexural and flexural-torsional 
              buckling. This modified slenderness approach is used in other steel standards, including the 
              AISC (AISC, 1999, 2005 and 2010a), CSA S136 (CSA S136, 1994), and CAN/CSA S16.1 
              (CAN/CSA S16.1-94, 1994). 
                 To prevent the flexural buckling of the individual shapes between intermediate connectors, 
              the intermediate fastener spacing, a, is limited such that a/r i  does not exceed one-half the 
              governing slenderness ratio of the built-up member (i.e., a/r i  ≤ 0.5(KL/r) o ). This intermediate 
              fastener spacing requirement is consistent with the previous edition of the AISI Specification 
              with the one-half factor included to account for any one of the connectors becoming loose or 
              ineffective. Note that the previous edition of S136 (S136, 1994) had no limit on fastener 
              spacing. 
                 The importance of preventing shear slip in the end connection is addressed by the 
              prescriptive requirements in Specification Section I1.2(b), adopted from AISC (AISC, 1999) and 
              CAN/CSA S16.1 (CAN/CSA S16.1-94, 1994). These provisions were added to the North 
              American Specification in 2001. 
                 The intermediate fastener(s) or weld(s) at any longitudinal member tie location is 
              required, as a group, to transmit a force equal to 2.5 percent of the nominal axial strength 
              [resistance] of the built-up member. A longitudinal member tie is defined as a location of 
              interconnection of the two members in contact. In the 2001 edition of the Specification, a 2.5 
              percent total force determined in accordance with appropriate load combinations was used 
              for design of the intermediate fastener(s) or weld(s). This requirement was adopted from 
              CSA S136-94. In 2004, the requirement was changed to be a function of the nominal axial 
              strength [resistance]. This change ensures that the nominal axial strength [resistance] of the built-
              up member is valid and is not compromised by the strength of the member interconnections. 
              To avoid confusion for different design methods, the minimum required strength [force due to 
              factored loads] of the interconnection changed to 2.5 percent of the available strength [factored 
              resistance] of the built-up member. 
                 Note that the provision in Specification Section I1.2 has been substantially taken from 
              research in hot-rolled built-up members connected with bolts or welds. These hot-rolled 
              provisions have been extended to include other fastener types common in cold-formed steel 
              construction (such as screws) provided they meet the 2.5 percent requirement for shear 
              strength and the conservative spacing requirement a/r i  ≤ 0.5(KL/r) o . 
             
              I1.3  Spacing of Connections in Cover-Plated Sections 

                 When compression elements are joined to other parts of built-up members by intermittent 
              connections, these connectors must be closely spaced to develop the required strength of the 
              connected element. Figure C-I1.3-1 shows a box-shaped beam made by connecting a flat sheet 
              to an inverted hat section. If the connectors are appropriately placed, this flat sheet will act as 
              a stiffened compression element with a width, w, equal to the distance between rows of 
              connectors, and the sectional properties can be calculated accordingly. This is the intent of the 
              provisions in Section I1.3 of the Specification. 
                 Section I1.3(a) of the Specification requires that the necessary shear strength be provided 
              by the same standard structural design procedure that is used in calculating flange connections 
              in bolted or welded plate girders or similar structures.

                 Section I1.3(b) of the Specification ensures that the part of the flat sheet between two 
              adjacent connectors will not buckle as a column (see Figure C-I1.3-1) at a stress less than 1.67f c  
              for ASD and f c  for LRFD and LSD, where f c  is the compressive stress in the connected 
              compression element (Winter, 1970; Yu and LaBoube, 2010). The AISI requirement is based 
              on the following Euler equation for column buckling: 
                      π2 E=σ cr          
                         )/(KLr2

              by substituting σcr  = αfc , where α=1.67 for ASD and α=1.0 for LRFD or LSD, K = 0.6, L = s, 
              and r = t/ 12 . This provision is conservative because the length is taken as the center 
              distance instead of the clear distance between connectors, and the coefficient K is taken as 0.6 
              instead of 0.5, which is the theoretical value for a column with fixed end supports. 









                                                                 
                             Figure C-I1.3-1 Spacing of Connectors in Composite Section 

                 Section I1.3(c) ensures satisfactory spacing to make a row of connectors act as a 
              continuous line of stiffening for the flat sheet under most conditions (Winter, 1970; Yu and 
              LaBoube, 2010). 
                 Specification Section 1.1.4 extends the limits of this section and uses the post-buckling 
              strength of the edge-stiffened compression plate. Specification Section 1.1.4 specifies the 
              parameter ranges that are validated by the research (Luttrell and Balaji, 1992; Snow and 
              Easterling, 2008). 
             
            I2 Floor, Roof, or Wall Steel Diaphragm Construction 

               In building construction, it has been a common practice to provide a separate bracing 
            system to resist horizontal loads due to wind load, blast force, or earthquake. However, steel 
            floor and roof panels, with or without concrete fill, are capable of resisting horizontal loads in 
            addition to the bending strength for gravity loads if they are adequately interconnected to each 
            other and to the supporting frame. The effective use of steel floor and roof decks can therefore 
            eliminate separate bracing systems and result in a reduction of building costs. For the same 
            reason, wall panels can not only provide enclosure surface and support normal loads, but they 
            can also provide diaphragm action in their own planes. 
               With the publication of AISI S310, North American Standard for the Design of Profiled Steel 
            Diaphragm Panels, the provisions in Specification Section I2 have moved to AISI S310. See AISI 
            S310-C for background information on floor, roof and wall steel diaphragm construction. See 
            AISI S240 and AISI S400 for information on the design and construction of cold-formed steel 
            framing with diagonal bracing or covered with sheathings other than fluted panels or cellular 
            deck.

            I3 Mixed Systems 

               When cold-formed steel members are used in conjunction with other construction materials, 
            the design requirements of the other material specifications must also be satisfied. 
                
            I4 Cold-Formed Steel Light-Frame Construction 

               In 2007, the scope of Section I4 on “Wall Studs and Wall Stud Assemblies” of the 2001 
            edition of the Specification with 2004 Supplement was broadened to include light-frame 
            construction. This was done in order to recognize the growing use of cold-formed steel framing 
            in a broader range of residential and light commercial framing applications and to provide a 
            means for either requiring or accepting use of the various ANSI-approved standards that have 
            been developed by the AISI Committee on Framing Standards. 
               In 2012, the reference to nonstructural members was removed from Section I4 because the 
            provisions for nonstructural members were moved from AISI S200, North American Standard for 
            Cold-Formed Steel Framing - General Provisions, to the newly developed AISI S220, North American 
            Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Nonstructural Members. 
               In 2016, the provisions for the design and installation of structural members and connections 
            utilized in cold-formed steel light-frame construction applications were consolidated in AISI S240, 
            North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Framing, from the following previously 
            referenced standards: 
            (a) AISI S200, North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—General Provisions 
            (b) AISI S210, North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Floor and Roof System 
               Design  
            (c) AISI S211, North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Wall Stud Design  
            (d) AISI S212, North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Header Design  
            (e) AISI S213, North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Lateral Design 
            (f) AISI S214, North American Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Framing—Truss Design 
               In 2016, AISI S400 was developed to address the design and construction of cold-formed steel 
            structural members and connections in seismic force-resisting systems and diaphragms in buildings 
            and other structures. AISI S400 is applicable in the United States and Mexico in Seismic Design 
            Categories (SDC) D, E, or F, or in SDC B or C with seismic response modification coefficient, R, 
            used to determine the seismic design forces is taken as other than 3; and in Canada where the 
            design spectral response acceleration S(0.2) as specified in the NBCC is greater than 0.12 and the 
            seismic force modification factors, R d Ro , used to determine the seismic design forces, are taken 
            as greater than or equal to 1.56. 
               AISI S220, AISI S240 and AISI S400 are available for adoption and use in the United States, 
            Canada and Mexico, and provide an integrated treatment of Allowable Strength Design (ASD), 
            Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), and Limit States Design (LSD). These framing standards 
            do not preclude the use of other materials, assemblies, structures or designs not meeting the 
            criteria herein when the other materials, assemblies, structures or designs demonstrate 
            equivalent performance for the intended use to those specified in the standards. 
             
              I4.1  All-Steel Design of Wall Stud Assemblies 

                 It is well known that column strength can be increased considerably by using adequate 
              bracing, even though the bracing is relatively flexible. This is particularly true for those

              sections generally used as load-bearing wall studs which have large I x /I y  ratios. 
                 Cold-formed I-, C-, Z-, or box-type studs are generally used in walls with their webs 
              placed perpendicular to the wall surface. The walls may be made of different materials such 
              as fiberboard, pulp board, plywood, or gypsum board. If the wall material is strong enough 
              and there is adequate attachment provided between wall material and studs for lateral 
              support of the studs, then the wall material can contribute to the structural economy by 
              increasing the usable strength of the studs substantially. 
                 In order to determine the necessary requirements for adequate lateral support of the wall 
              studs, theoretical and experimental investigations were conducted in the 1940s by Green, 
              Winter, and Cuykendall (1947). The study included 102 tests on studs and 24 tests on a 
              variety of wall material. Based on the findings of this earlier investigation, specific AISI 
              provisions were developed for the design of wall studs. 
                 In the 1970s, the structural behavior of columns braced by steel diaphragms was a special 
              subject investigated at Cornell University and other institutions. The renewed investigation 
              of wall-braced studs has indicated that the bracing provided for studs by steel panels is of the 
              shear diaphragm type rather than the linear type, which was considered in the 1947 study. 
              Simaan (1973) and Simaan and Peköz (1976), which are summarized by Yu (2000), contain 
              procedures for computing the strength of C- and Z-section wall studs that are braced by 
              sheathing materials. The bracing action is due to both the shear rigidity and the rotational 
              restraint supplied by the sheathing material. The treatment by Simaan (1973) and Simaan and 
              Peköz (1976) is quite general and includes the case of studs braced on one as well as on both 
              flanges. However, the provisions of Section I4 of the 1980 Specification dealt only with the 
              simplest case of identical sheathing material on both sides of the stud. For simplicity, only the 
              restraint due to the shear rigidity of the sheathing material was considered. 
                 The 1989 Addendum to the AISI Specification included the design limitations from the 
              Commentary and introduced stub column tests and/or rational analysis for the design of studs 
              with perforations (Davis and Yu, 1972; Rack Manufacturers Institute, 1990). 
                 In 1996, the design provisions were revised to permit: (a) all-steel design, and (b) 
              sheathing braced design of wall studs with either solid or perforated webs. For sheathing-
              braced design, in order to be effective, sheathing must retain its design strength and integrity 
              for the expected service life of the wall. Of particular concern is the use of gypsum sheathing 
              in a moist environment.  
                 In 2004, the sheathing-braced design provisions were removed from the Specification and 
              a requirement added that sheathing-braced design be based on appropriate theory, tests, or 
              rational engineering analysis that can be found in AISI (2004a); Green, Winter, and Cuykendall 
              (1947); Simaan (1973); and Simaan and Peköz (1976). 
                 In 2007, in addition to the revisions of Specification Section I4 as discussed in this 
              Commentary, the provisions for noncircular holes were moved from Specification Section I4.1 
              to Section 1.1.1 on “Uniformly Compressed Stiffened Elements With Circular or Noncircular 
              Holes”. Within the limitations stated for the size and spacing of perforations and section 
              depth, the provisions were deemed appropriate for members with uniformly compressed 
              stiffened elements, not just wall studs. 
             
            I5 Special Bolted Moment Frame Systems 

               In 2015, AISI S110, Standard for Seismic Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Systems - Special 
            Bolted Moment Frames, was incorporated into AISI S400.

            I6 Metal Roof and Wall Systems 

               For members connected to deck or metal sheathing, the member flexural and compression 
            strengths as well as bracing requirements are provided in Specification Section I6. Two strength 
            prediction methods are provided—one for general cross-sections and system connectivity 
            (Section I6.1), and one for specific cross-sections and system connectivity (Section I6.2). The 
            provisions in Specification Section I6.1 directly calculate member capacity, including stiffness 
            from connected roof or wall panels, bridging and bracing, span continuity, and torsion from 
            loading eccentric to the shear center and from roof slope. The provisions in Specification Section 
            I6.2 define wall and roof system capacity based on past experiments for variables within 
            defined limits. 
             
              I6.1  Member Strength: General Cross-Sections and System Connectivity 

                 This method provides a means for directly calculating the axial and flexural capacity of 
              members (such as purlins and girts) connected to deck, sheathing, or through-fastened or 
              standing seam panels. The approach employs the Direct Strength Method and available 
              computational tools; for example, the finite strip elastic buckling program CUFSM (Li and 
              Schafer, 2010).  
                 An elastic buckling analysis is performed that includes the test-derived rotational, 
              translational, and composite stiffness provided by the panel or sheathing connection to the 
              members (Schafer, 2013; Gao and Moen, 2013a). The member critical elastic local, distortional, 
              and global buckling loads or moments are calculated considering wall or roof connection 
              stiffness, end support conditions, span continuity, and bridging and bracing. Member 
              slenderness, including the wall or roof system influence, is determined within the Direct 
              Strength Method to predict axial or flexural capacity.   
                 Panel, deck, and sheathing rotational and translational stiffnesses are available for bare 
              deck through-fastened to members (Gao and Moen, 2012; Pham et al., 2016), deck with rigid 
              board insulation (Gao, 2012), and for through-fastened and standing seam insulated metal 
              panels (IMPs) (Wu and Moen, 2015). Composite stiffness developed by the connection 
              between the panel and a member can also be approximated (Vieira, 2011).   
                 In many cases, the applied load on a member is eccentric to its shear center from forces 
              applied through the flange connection or because of a sloped roof. The warping torsion stresses 
              are directly calculated in these cases and a reduction factor, R, determined in accordance with 
              Specification Equation H4-1, is used to reduce the capacity for combined flexure and torsion. 
              The reduction factor should be applied to nominal strength [resistance], M n,  considering local, 
              distortional, and global buckling limit states. 
                 The method described above can be applied to members with, generally, any cross-
              section and system connectivity. Supporting documentation for this method applied to metal 
              building wall and roof systems comes from experimental, computational, and analytical 
              studies conducted between 2009 and 2015, including Gao and Moen (2013a and 2013b). 
              Example calculations are available for many of these systems (Moen, 2015), including 
              standing seam roofs (Moen, et al., 2012). 
                 The design methodology for general cross-sections and system connectivity has been 
              thoroughly validated. The strength predictions were compared to a database of 62 through-

              this database comparison is 1.05 and 0.18, respectively, corresponding to an LRFD resistance

              I6.2  Member Strength: Specific Cross-Sections and System Connectivity 

                I6.2.1 Flexural Members Having One Flange Through-Fastened to Deck or Sheathing 

                   For beams having the tension flange attached to deck or sheathing and the compression 
                flange unbraced, e.g., a roof purlin or wall girt subjected to wind suction, the bending 
                capacity is less than a fully braced member, but greater than an unbraced member. This 
                partial restraint is a function of the rotational stiffness provided by the panel-to-purlin 
                connection. The Specification contains factors that represent the reduction in capacity from a 
                fully braced condition. These factors are based on experimental results obtained for both 
                simple and continuous span purlins (Peköz and Soroushian, 1981 and 1982; LaBoube, 1986; 
                Haussler and Pahers, 1973; LaBoube, et al., 1988; Haussler, 1988; Fisher, 1996). 
                   The R factors for simple span C-sections and Z-sections up to 8.5 inches (216 mm) in 
                depth have been increased from the 1986 Specification, and a member design yield stress 
                limit added based on the work by Fisher (1996). 
                   As indicated by LaBoube (1986), the rotational stiffness of the panel-to-purlin connection 
                is primarily a function of the member thickness, sheet thickness, fastener type and fastener 
                location. To ensure adequate rotational stiffness of the roof and wall systems designed 
                using the AISI provisions, Specification Section I6.2.1 explicitly states the acceptable panel 
                and fastener types. 
                   Continuous beam tests were made on three equal spans and the R values were 
                calculated from the failure loads using a maximum positive moment, M = 0.08 wL 2 . 
                   The provisions of Specification Section I6.2.1 apply to beams for which the tension flange 
                is attached to deck or sheathing and the compression flange is completely unbraced. Beams 
                with discrete point braces on the compression flange may have a bending capacity greater 
                than those completely unbraced. Available data from simple span tests (Peköz and 
                Soroushian, 1981 and 1982; LaBoube and Thompson, 1982a; LaBoube, et al., 1988; LaBoube 
                and Golovin, 1990) indicate that for members having a lip edge stiffener at an angle of 75 
                degrees or greater with the plane of the compression flange and braces to the compression 
                flange located at third points or more frequently, member capacities may be increased over 
                those without discrete braces. 
                   For the LRFD method, the use of the reduced nominal flexural strength [resistance] 
                (Specification Equation I6.2.1-1) with a resistance factor of φb  = 0.90 provides the β values 
                varying from 1.5 to 1.60, which are satisfactory for the target value of 1.5. This analysis was 
                based on the load combination of 1.17 W - 0.9D using a reduction factor of 0.9 applied to the 
                load factor for the nominal wind load, where W and D are nominal wind and dead loads, 
                respectively (Hsiao, Yu and Galambos, 1988a; AISI, 1991). 
                   In 2007, the panel depth was reduced from 1-1/4 inch (32 mm) to 1-1/8 inch (29 mm). 
                This reduction in depth was justified because the behavior during full-scale tests indicated 
                that the panel deformation was restricted to a relatively small area around the screw 
                attachment of the panel to the purlin. Also, tests by LaBoube (1986) demonstrated that the 
                panel depth did not influence the rotational stiffness of the panel-to-purlin attachment.

                   Prior to the 2001 edition, the Specification specifically limited the applicability of these 
                provisions to continuous purlin and girt systems in which any given span length did not 
                vary from any other span length by more than 20 percent. This limitation was included in 
                recognition of the fact that the research was based on systems with equal bay spacing. In 
                2007, the Specification was revised to permit purlin and girt systems with adjacent span 
                lengths varying more than 20 percent to use the reduction factor, R, for the simply 
                supported condition. The revision allows a row of continuous purlins or girts to be treated 
                with a continuous beam condition R-factor in some bays and a simple span beam condition 
                R-factor in others. The 20 percent span variation rule is a local effect and as such, only 
                variation in adjacent spans is relevant.  
                   In 2012, based on tests reported by Wibbenmeyer (2009), the limitation on the member 
                depth was increased to 12 in. (305 mm), the ratio of depth-to-flange width was increased to 
                5.5, and a minimum flange width of 2.125 in. (54.0 mm) was added. The ratio of tensile 
                strength to yield stress of 1.08 was added based on research at the University of Sydney 
                (Pham and Hancock, 2009), which is also consistent with the applicable steels listed in 
                Specification Section A2. The average depth-to-flange width ratio based on measured 
                properties in the research by Wibbenmeyer (2009) was 5.3. However, the limit was 
                increased to 5.5 in the Specification. This increased value was justified because the smallest 
                measured purlin flange width for any of the members tested by Wibbenmeyer (2009) was 
                2.1875 in. (71.56 mm), which resulted in a ratio of depth-to-flange width of 5.5. Also, the 
                reported value of R for the 12-in. (305-mm) deep purlins significantly exceeded those 
                previously stipulated for 11.5-in. (292-mm) deep members. 
                   The provisions of Specification Section H4, Combined Bending and Torsion, should not 
                be used in combination with the bending provisions in Specification Section I6.2.1 since 
                these provisions are based on tests in which torsional effects are present.

                I6.2.3 Compression Members Having One Flange Through-Fastened to Deck or Sheathing 

                   For axially loaded C- or Z-sections having one flange attached to deck or sheathing and 
                the other flange unbraced, e.g., a roof purlin or wall girt subjected to wind- or seismic- 
                generated compression forces, the axial load capacity is less than a fully braced member, 
                but greater than an unbraced member. The partial restraint relative to weak axis buckling is 
                a function of the rotational stiffness provided by the panel-to-purlin connection. Specification 
                Equation I6.2.3-1 is used to calculate the weak axis capacity. This equation is not valid for 
                sections attached to standing seam roofs. The equation was developed by Glaser, Kaehler 
                and Fisher (1994) and is also based on the work contained in the reports of Hatch, 
                Easterling and Murray (1990), and Simaan (1973). 
                   A limitation on the maximum yield stress of the C- or Z-section is not given in the 
                Specification since Specification Equation I6.2.3-1 is based on elastic buckling criteria. A 
                limitation on minimum length is not contained in the Specification because Equation  
                I6.2.3-1 is conservative for spans less than 15 feet. The gross area, A, has been used rather 
                than the effective area, A e , because the ultimate axial stress is generally not large enough to 
                result in a significant reduction in the effective area for common cross-section geometries.

                   As indicated in the Specification, the strong axis axial load capacity is determined by 
                assuming that the weak axis of the strut is braced. 
                   The controlling axial capacity (weak or strong axis) is suitable for usage in the 
                combined axial load and bending equations in Section H1 of the Specification (Hatch, 
                Easterling, and Murray, 1990). 
                   Note: As stated in the Specification, when a member is designed in accordance with 
                Section I6.2.3, Compression Members Having One Flange Through-Fastened to Deck or 
                Sheathing, the provisions of Section E4.1, Distortional Buckling Strength [Resistance], need 
                not be applied since distortional buckling is inherently included as a limit state in Section 
                I6.2.3 on strength prediction equations.

              I6.3  Standing Seam Roof Panel Systems 

                I6.3.1 Strength [Resistance] of Standing Seam Roof Panel Systems 

                   Under gravity loading, the nominal strength [resistance] of many panels can be calculated 
                accurately. Under uplift loading, nominal strength [resistance] of standing seam roof panels 
                and their attachments or anchors cannot be calculated with accuracy. Therefore, it is 
                necessary to determine the nominal strength [resistance] by testing. Three test protocols have 
                been used in this effort: FM 4471 developed by Factory Mutual, CEGS 07416 by the U.S. 
                Army Corps of Engineers and ASTM E1592. In Supplement No. 1 to the 1996 edition of the 
                Specification, (AISI, 1999), only the ASTM E1592-95 procedure was approved. In 2004, the 
                Factory Mutual and Corps of Engineers protocols were also approved, provided that 
                testing was in accordance with the AISI test procedure defined in S906 (AISI, 2002). While 
                these test procedures have a common base, none define a design strength [factored resistance]. 
                Specification Section I6.3.1 and AISI S906, Standard Procedures for Panel and Anchor Structural 
                Tests, adopted in 1999, added closure to the question by defining appropriate resistance and 
                safety factors. The safety factors determined in Section I6.3.1 will vary depending on the 
                characteristics of the test data. In 2006, limits were placed on the safety factor and resistance 
                factor determined in this section to require a minimum safety factor of 1.67 and a maximum 
                resistance factor of 0.9. 
                   The Specification permits end conditions other than those prescribed by ASTM E1592-
                01. Areas of the roof plane that are sufficiently far enough away from crosswise restraint 
                can be simulated by testing the open/open condition that was permitted in the 1995 
                edition of ASTM E1592. In addition, eave and ridge configurations that do not provide 
                crosswise restraint can be evaluated.  
                   The relationship of strength to serviceability limits may be taken as strength 
                limit/serviceability limit = 1.25, or 
                  Ωserviceability  = Ωstrength /1.25                                        (C-I6.3.1-1) 
                   It should be noted that the purpose of the test procedure specified in Specification 
                Section I6.3.1 is not to set up guidelines to establish the serviceability limit. The purpose is 
                to define the method of determining the available strength [factored resistance] whether based

                on the serviceability limit or on the nominal strength [resistance]. The Corps of Engineers 
                Procedure CEGS 07416 (1991) requires a safety factor of 1.65 on strength and 1.3 on 
                serviceability. A buckling or crease does not have the same consequences as a failure of a 
                clip. In the latter case, the roof panel itself may become detached and expose the contents 
                of a building to the elements of the environment. Further, Galambos (1988a) recommended 
                a value of 2.0 for the target reliability index, βo ,  when slight damage is expected and a 
                value of 2.5 when moderate damage is expected. The resulting ratio is 1.25.  
                   In Specification Section I6.3.1, a target reliability index of 2.5 is used for connection limits. 
                It is used because the consequences of a panel fastener failure (βo  = 2.5) are not nearly as 
                severe as the consequences of a primary frame connection failure (βo  = 3.5). The intermittent 
                nature of wind load as compared to the relatively long duration of snow load further 
                justifies the use of βo  = 2.5 for panel anchors. In Specification Section I6.3.1, the coefficient of 
                variation of the material factor, V M , is recommended to be 0.08 for failure limited by 
                anchor or connection failure, and 0.10 for limits caused by flexural or other modes of failure. 
                Specification Section I6.3.1 also eliminates the limit on coefficient of variation of the test 
                results, V p , because consistent test results often lead to V p  values lower than the 6.5 
                percent value set in Specification Section K2.1. The elimination of the limit will be beneficial 
                when test results are consistent. 
                   The value for the number of tests for fasteners is set as the number of anchors tested 
                with the same tributary area as the anchor that failed. This is consistent with design 
                practice where anchors are checked using a load calculated based on tributary area. Actual 
                anchor loads are not calculated from a stiffness analysis of the panel in ordinary design 
                practice.

                I6.4.1 Anchorage of Bracing for Purlin Roof Systems Under Gravity Load With Top Flange 
                      Connected to Metal Sheathing 

                   In metal roof systems utilizing C- or Z-purlins, the application of gravity loads will 
                cause torsion in the purlin and lateral displacements of the roof system. These effects are 
                due to the slope of the roof, the loading of the member eccentric to its shear center, and for 
                Z-purlins, the inclination of the principal axes. The torsional effects are not accounted for in 
                the design provisions of Chapter F, Sections I6.1 and I6.2; and lateral displacements may 
                create instability in the system. Lateral restraint is typically provided by the roof sheathing 
                and lateral anchorage devices to minimize the lateral movement and the torsional effects. 
                The anchorage devices are designed to resist the lateral anchorage force and provide the 
                appropriate level of stiffness to ensure the overall stability of the purlins.  
                   The calculation procedure in Specification Equations I6.4.1-1 through I6.4.1-6 determines 
                the anchorage force by first calculating an upper bound force for each purlin, P i , at the line 
                of anchorage. This upper bound force is then distributed to anchorage devices and reduced 
                due to the system stiffness based on the relative effective stiffness of each component. For 
                the calculation procedure, the anchorage devices are modeled as linear springs located at 
                the top of the purlin web. The stiffness of anchorage devices that do not attach at this 
                location must be adjusted, through analysis or testing, to an equivalent lateral stiffness at

                the top of the web. This adjustment must include the influence of the attached purlin but 
                not include any reduction due to the flexibility of the sheathing to purlin connection. 
                Specification Equation I6.4.1-4 establishes an effective lateral stiffness for each anchorage 
                device, relative to each purlin, that has been adjusted for the flexibility of the roof system 
                between the purlin location and the anchorage location. It is important to note that the 
                units of A p  are area per unit width. Therefore the bay length, L, in this equation must have 
                units consistent with the unit width used for establishing A p . The resulting product, LA p , 
                has units of area. The total effective stiffness for a given purlin is then calculated with 
                Specification Equation I6.4.1-5 by summarizing the effective stiffness relative to each 
                anchorage device and the system stiffness from Specification Equation I6.4.1-6. The force 
                generated by an individual purlin is calculated by Equation I6.4.1-2, and then distributed to 
                an anchorage device based on the relative stiffness ratio in Specification Equation I6.4.1-1. 
                   Lateral bracing forces will accumulate within the roof sheathing and must be 
                transferred into the anchorage devices. The strength of the elements in this load path must 
                be verified. AISI S912, Test Procedures for Determining a Strength Value for a Roof Panel-to-
                Purlin-to-Anchorage Device Connection, provides a means to determine a lower bound 
                strength for the complete load path. For through-fastened roof systems, this strength value 
                can be reasonably estimated by rational analysis by assuming that the roof fasteners within 
                12 inches (305 mm) of the anchorage device participate in the force transfer. 
                   The 1986 through 2001 Specifications included brace force equations that were based on 
                the work by Murray and Elhouar (1985) with various extensions from subsequent work. 
                The original work assumed the applied loading was parallel to the purlin webs. The later 
                addition of the “cosθ” and “sinθ” terms attempted to account for the roof slope, but it 
                failed to correctly model the system effect for higher-sloped roofs. Tests by Lee and 
                Murray (2001) and Seek and Murray (2004) showed generally that the brace force 
                equations conservatively predicted the lateral anchorage forces at slopes less than 1:12, but 
                predicted unconservative lateral anchorage forces at steeper slopes. The new procedure 
                outlined in Specification Section I6.4.1 was formulated to correlate better with test results. 
                Also, the original work was based on the application of one anchorage device to a group of 
                purlins. Until the work of Sears and Murray (2007), a generally accepted manual technique 
                to extend this procedure to roofs with multiple anchors was not available. 
                   Prior to the work by Seek and Murray (2006, 2007) and Sears and Murray (2007), the 
                anchorage devices were assumed to have a constant and relatively high lateral stiffness. 
                The current provisions recognize the finite stiffness of the anchorage device, and the 
                corresponding decrease in anchorage forces for more flexible anchorage devices. 
                Specification Equation I6.4.1-7 establishes a minimum effective stiffness that must be 
                provided to limit the lateral displacement at the anchorage device to d/20. This required 
                stiffness does not represent the required stiffness of each anchorage device, but instead the 
                total stiffness provided by the stiffness of the purlin system (K sys ) and the anchorage 
                devices relative to the most remote purlin.  
                   Several alternative rational analysis methods have been developed to predict lateral 
                anchorage forces for Z-section roof systems. A method for calculating lateral anchorage 
                forces is presented by Seek and Murray (2006, 2007). The method is similar to the 
                procedure outlined in Specification Section I6.4.1 but uses a more complex method derived 
                from mechanics to determine the lateral force introduced into the system at each Z-section, 
                Pi , and distributes the force to the components of the system according to the relative

                lateral stiffness of each of the components. The method is more computationally intensive, 
                but allows for analysis of more complex bracing configurations such as supports plus third 
                points lateral anchorage and supports plus third points torsional braces. 
                   A method to predict lateral anchorage forces using the finite element method is 
                presented in Seek and Murray (2004). The model uses shell finite elements to model the Z-
                sections and sheathing in the roof system. The model accurately represents Z-section 
                behavior and is capable of handling configurations other than lateral anchorage applied at 
                the top flange. However, the computational complexity limits the size of the roof system 
                that can be modeled by this method. 
                   Rational analysis may also be performed using the elastic stiffness model developed by 
                Sears and Murray (2007) upon which the provisions of Specification Section I6.4.1 are based. 
                The model uses frame finite elements to represent the Z-sections and a truss system to 
                represent the diaphragm. The model is computationally efficient, allowing for analysis of 
                large systems. 
                   Anchorage is most commonly applied along the frame lines due to the effectiveness 
                and ease in which the forces are transferred out of the system. In the absence of substantial 
                diaphragm stiffness, anchorage may be required along the interior of the span to prevent 
                large lateral displacements. Torsional braces applied along the span of a Z- or C-section 
                provide an alternative to interior anchorage. 
             
                I6.4.2 Alternative Lateral and Stability Bracing for Purlin Roof Systems 

                   Tests (Shadravan and Ramseyer, 2007) have shown that C- and Z-sections can reach the 
                capacity determined by Specification Chapter F through the application of torsional braces 
                along the span of the member. Torsional braces applied between pairs of purlins prevent 
                twist of the section at a discrete location. The moments developed due to the torsional 
                brace can be resolved by forces in the plane of the web of each section and do not require 
                external anchorage at the location of the brace. The vertical forces should, however, be 
                accounted for when determining the applied load on the section. 
                   Torsional braces should be applied at or near each flange of the Z- or C-section to 
                prevent deformation of the web of the section and ensure the effectiveness of the brace. 
                When twist of the section is thus prevented, a section may deflect laterally and retain its 
                strength. Second-order moments can be resisted by the rotational restraints. Therefore, a 
                more liberal lateral deflection of L/180 between the supports is permitted for a C- or Z- 
                section with torsional braces. Anchorage is required at the frame line to prevent excessive 
                deformation at the support location that undermines the strength of the section. A lateral 
                displacement limit, therefore, is imposed along the frame lines to ensure that adequate 
                restraint is provided. 
             
            I7 Rack Systems 

               Steel rack systems are designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI MH16.1. See the 
            commentary on MH16.1 for information.

            J. CONNECTIONS AND JOINTS 
            J1 General Provisions 

               Welds, bolts, screws, rivets, and other special devices such as metal stitching and adhesives 
            are generally used for cold-formed steel connections (Brockenbrough, 1995). The 2016 edition of 
            the Specification contains provisions in Chapter J for welded connections, bolted connections, 
            screw connections, and power–actuated fastener connections. Among these commonly used types of 
            connections, the design provisions for using screws were developed in 1993 and were included 
            in the 1996 Specification for the first time, and the design provisions for power-actuated fasteners 
            were added in the 2012 Specification. The following brief discussions deal with the application of 
            rivets and other special devices: 
            (a) Rivets 
               While hot rivets have little application in cold-formed steel construction, cold rivets find 
               considerable use, particularly in special forms such as blind rivets (for application from one 
               side only), tubular rivets (to increase bearing area), high shear rivets, and explosive rivets. 
               For the design of connections using cold rivets, the provisions for bolted connections may be 
               used as a general guide, except that the shear strength of rivets may be quite different from 
               that of bolts. Additional design information on the strength of rivets should be obtained 
               from manufacturers or from tests. 
            (b) Special Devices 
               Special devices include: (1) metal stitching, achieved by tools that are special 
               developments of the common office stapler, and (2) connecting by means of special 
               clinching tools that draw the sheets into interlocking projections. 
               Most of these connections are proprietary devices for which information on strength of 
               connections must be obtained from manufacturers or from tests carried out by or for the user. 
               Guidelines provided in Specification Section K2 are to be used in these tests. 
               The plans or specifications are to contain information and design requirement data for 
               the adequate detailing of each connection if the connection is not detailed on the engineering 
               design drawings. 
             
               In the 2001 edition of the Specification, the ASD, LRFD and LSD design provisions for welded 
            and bolted connections were based on the 1996 edition of the Specification, with some revisions 
            and additions which will be discussed in subsequent sections. Most of those design provisions 
            were kept in this edition of the Specification. Some content reorganization was made in 2010, 
            where shear rupture check for welds and fasteners was moved to Section J6.  
             
            J2 Welded Connections 

               Welds used for cold-formed steel construction may be classified as fusion welds (or arc 
            welds) and resistance welds. Fusion welding is used for connecting cold-formed steel members 
            to each other as well as connecting such members to heavy, hot-rolled steel framing (such as 
            floor panels to beams of the steel frame). It is used in groove welds, arc spot welds, arc seam 
            welds, fillet welds, and flare-groove welds. 
               The design provisions contained in this Specification section for fusion welds have been 
            based primarily on experimental evidence obtained from an extensive test program conducted

            at Cornell University. The results of this program are reported by Peköz and McGuire (1979) 
            and summarized by Yu and LaBoube (2010). In addition, the Cornell research provided the 
            experimental basis for the AWS Structural Welding Code for Sheet Steel (AWS, 1998). In most 
            cases, the provisions of the AWS code are in agreement with this Specification section. All 
            possible failure modes are covered in the Specification since 1996, whereas the earlier 
            Specifications mainly dealt with shear failure. 
               For most of the connection tests reported by Peköz and McGuire (1979), the onset of yielding 
            was either poorly defined or followed closely by failure. Therefore, in the provisions of this 
            section, rupture rather than yielding is used as a more reliable criterion of failure. 
               The welded connection tests, which served as the basis of the provisions given in Specification 
            Sections J2.1 through J2.7, were conducted on sections with single and double sheets (see 
            Specification Figures J2.2-1 and J2.2-2). The largest total sheet thickness of the cover plates was 
            approximately 0.15 inch (3.81 mm). However, within this Specification, the validity of the 
            equations was extended to welded connections in which the thickness of the thinnest connected 
            part is 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) or less. For arc spot welds, the maximum thickness of a single sheet 
            (Specification Figure J2.2.2.1-1) and the combined thickness of double sheets (Specification Figure 
            J2.2.2.1-2) are set at 0.15 inch (3.81 mm). 
               The upper limit of the Specification applicability was revised in 2004 from 0.18 in. (4.57 mm) 
            to 3/16 in. (4.76 mm). This change was made to be consistent with the limit given in AWS D1.3 
            (1998). 
               In 2001, the safety factors and resistance factors in this section were modified for consistency 
            based on the research work by Tangorra, Schuster, and LaBoube (2001). 
               For design tables and example problems on welded connections, see Part IV of the Cold-
            Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013). 
             
              J2.1  Groove Welds in Butt Joints 

                 The design equations for determining nominal strength [resistance] for groove welds in butt 
              joints have been taken from the AISC LRFD Specification (AISC, 1993). Therefore, the AISC 
              definition for the effective throat thickness, t e , is equally applicable to this section of the 
              Specification. Prequalified joint details are given in AWS D1.3-98 (AWS, 1998) or other 
              equivalent weld standards. 
                 In 2010, Specification Section J2.1(a) was revised to delete the case for tension or 
              compression parallel to the axis of the weld, so that Specification Equation J2.1-1 is applicable 
              only to tension or compression normal to the effective area of the weld. For tension or 
              compression parallel to the weld axis, the computation of the weld strength is not required 
              (AISC, 2005 and 2010a). 
             
              J2.2  Arc Spot Welds 

                 Arc spot welds (puddle welds) used for connecting thin sheets are similar to plug welds 
              used for relatively thicker plates. The difference between plug welds and arc spot welds is 
              that the former are made with pre-punched holes, but no pre-punched holes are required for 
              the latter. Instead, a hole is burned in the top sheet by the arc and then filled with weld metal 
              to fuse it to the bottom sheet or a framing member. The provisions of Section J2.2 apply to 
              plug welds as well as spot welds.

                J2.2.1 Minimum Edge and End Distance 

                   In the 2001 and 2007 editions of the Specification, the distance measured in the line of 
                force from the centerline of weld to the nearest edge of an adjacent weld or to the end of 
                the connected part toward which the force is directed was required to not be less than e min , 
                which is equal to required strength [forces due to factored loads] divided by (tF u ). In 2010, an 
                equivalent resistance was determined by the use of Section J6.1.  
             
                J2.2.2 Shear 

                  J2.2.2.1  Shear Strength for Sheet(s) Welded to a Thicker Supporting Member 

                     The Cornell tests (Peköz and McGuire, 1979) identified four modes of failure for arc 
                  spot welds, which are addressed in this Specification section. They are: (1) shear failure of 
                  welds in the fused area, (2) tearing of the sheet along the contour of the weld with the 
                  tearing spreading the sheet at the leading edge of the weld, (3) sheet tearing combined 
                  with buckling near the trailing edge of the weld, and (4) shearing of the sheet behind the 
                  weld. It should be noted that many failures, particularly those of the plate tearing type, 
                  may be preceded or accompanied by considerable inelastic out-of-plane deformation of 
                  the type indicated in Figure C-J2.2.2.1-1. This form of behavior is similar to that observed 
                  in wide, pin-connected plates. Such behavior should be avoided by closer spacing of 
                  welds. When arc spot welds are used to connect two sheets to a framing member as 
                  shown in Specification Figure J2.2.2.1-2, consideration should also be given to possible 
                  shear failure between thin sheets. 














                                                                         
                              Figure C-J2.2.2.1-1 Out-of-Plane Distortion of Welded Connection 

                    The thickness limitation of 0.15 inch (3.81 mm) is due to the range of the test program 
                  that served as the basis of these provisions. On sheets below 0.028-inch (0.711-mm) thick, 
                  weld washers are required to avoid excessive burning of the sheets and, therefore, 
                  inferior quality welds. 
                   Specification Equation J2.2.2.1-1 shows that the nominal shear strength [resistance] of arc 
                  spot welds is proportional to the square of effective diameter, d e , of fused area at plane 
                  of maximum shear transfer. Since d e  = 0.7d-1.5t ≤ 0.55d in accordance with Specification 
                  Equation J2.2.2.1-5, a larger visible diameter, d, may be needed if the welded sheet 
                  thickness, t, is increased.

                  J2.2.2.2  Shear Strength for Sheet-to-Sheet Connections 

                     The Steel Deck Institute (SDI) Diaphragm Design Manual (SDI, 1987 and 2004) 
                  stipulates that the shear strength for a sheet-to-sheet arc spot weld connection be taken as 
                  75 percent of the strength of a sheet-to-structural connection. SDI further stipulates that 
                  the sheet-to-structural connection strength be defined by Specification Equation J2.2.2.1-2. 
                  This design provision was adopted by the Specification in 2004. Prior to accepting the SDI 
                  design recommendation, a review of the pertinent research by Luttrell (SDI, 1987) was 
                  performed by LaBoube (2001). The tested sheet thickness range that is reflected in the 
                  Specification documents is based on the scope of Luttrell’s test program. SDI suggests 
                  that sheet-to-sheet welds are problematic for thicknesses of less than 0.0295 in. (0.75 mm). 
                  Such welds result in “blow holes,” but the perimeter must be fused to be effective.  
                     Quality control for sheet–to-sheet connections is not within the purview of AWS D1.3. 
                  However, using AWS D1.3 as a guide, the following quality control/assurance 
                  guidelines are suggested: 
                  (1) Measure the visible diameter of the weld face, 
                  (2) Ensure no cracks in the welds, 
                  (3) Maximum undercut = 1/8 of the weld circumference, and 
                  (4) Sheets are to be in contact with each other. 
             
                J2.2.3 Tension 

                   For tensile capacity of arc spot welds, the design provisions in the 1989 Specification 
                Addendum were based on the tests reported by Fung (1978) and the study made by 
                Albrecht (1988). Those provisions were limited to sheet failure with restrictive limitations 
                on material properties and sheet thickness. These design criteria were revised in 1996 
                because the tests conducted at the University of Missouri-Rolla (LaBoube and Yu, 1991 and 
                1993) have shown that two potential limit states may occur. The most common failure mode 
                is that of sheet tearing around the perimeter of the weld. This failure condition was found 
                to be influenced by the sheet thickness, the average weld diameter, and the material tensile 
                strength. In some cases, it was found that tensile failure of the weld can occur. The strength 
                of the weld was determined to be a function of the cross-section of the fused area and 
                tensile strength of the weld material. Based on analysis by LaBoube (2001), the nominal 
                strength [resistance] equation was changed in 2001 to reflect the ductility of the sheet, F u /F y , 
                and the sheet thickness, the average weld diameter, and the material tensile strength. 
                   The multiple safety factors and resistance factors recognize the behavior of a panel system 
                with many connections versus the behavior of a member connection and the potential for a 
                catastrophic failure in each application. In Specification Section J2.2.3, a target reliability 
                index of 3.0 for the United States and Mexico and 3.5 for Canada is used for the panel 
                connection limit, whereas a target reliability index of 3.5 for the United States and Mexico 
                and 4 for Canada is used for the other connection limit. Precedence for the use of a smaller 
                target reliability index for systems was established in Section I6.3.1 of the Specification. 
                   Tests (LaBoube and Yu, 1991 and 1993) have also shown that when reinforced by a 
                weld washer, thin sheet weld connections can achieve the nominal strength [resistance] given 
                by Specification Equation J2.2.3-2 using the thickness of the thinner sheet. 
                   The equations given in the Specification were derived from the tests for which the 
                applied tension load imposed a concentric load on the weld, as would be the case, for

                example, for the interior welds on a roof system subjected to wind uplift. Welds on the 
                perimeter of a roof or floor system would experience an eccentric tensile loading due to 
                wind uplift. Tests have shown that as much as a 50 percent reduction in nominal connection 
                strength [resistance] could occur because of the eccentric load application (LaBoube and Yu, 
                1991 and 1993). Eccentric conditions may also occur at connection laps as depicted by Figure 
                C-J2.2.3-1. 
                   At a lap connection between two deck sections as shown in Figure C-J2.2.3-1, the length 
                of the unstiffened flange and the extent of the encroachment of the weld into the 
                unstiffened flange have a measurable influence on the strength of the welded connection 
                (LaBoube and Yu, 1991). The Specification recognizes the reduced capacity of this connection 
                detail by imposing a 30 percent reduction on the calculated nominal strength [resistance].

                J2.2.4 Combined Shear and Tension on an Arc Spot Weld 

                   The Steel Deck Institute Diaphragm Design Manual (2004) provides a design equation for 
                evaluating the strength of an arc spot weld connection subject to combined shear and 
                tension forces. An experimental investigation was conducted at the University of 
                Missouri–Rolla to study the behavior and to develop design recommendations for the 
                relationship (interaction) of the tension and shear forces on an arc spot weld connection 
                (Stirnemann and LaBoube, 2007).  
                   The experimental study focused on six variables that were deemed to be the key 
                parameters that could influence the strength of the arc spot weld connection. These 
                variables were the sheet thickness; sheet material properties including yield stress, tensile 
                strength and ductility of the sheet; visible diameter of the arc spot weld; and the 
                relationship between the magnitude of the shear force and tension force. Based on an 
                analysis of the test results, the Steel Deck Institute’s interaction equation was found to 
                provide an acceptable estimate of the strength of the arc spot weld connection.  
             
              J2.3  Arc Seam Welds 

                 The general behavior of arc seam welds is similar to that of arc spot welds. In 2010, 
              Section J2.3 was reorganized to be consistent with provisions provided for arc spot welds.

                  and McGuire, 1979). Therefore, Specification Equation J2.3.2.1-1, which accounts for shear 
                  failure of welds, is adopted from the AWS welding provisions for sheet steel (AWS, 
                  1998). 
                     Specification Equation J2.3.2.1-2 is intended to prevent failure through a combination 
                  of tensile tearing plus shearing of the cover plates. 
             
                  J2.3.2.2  Shear Strength for Sheet-to-Sheet Connections 

                     In 2010, the provisions for determining the shear strength of sheet-to-sheet arc spot 
                  weld connections were adopted for arc seam weld connections. This is conservative 
                  because the length of the seam weld is not considered. 
             
              J2.4  Top Arc Seam Sidelap Welds 

                 Top arc seam sidelap welds (often referred to as TSWs) have commonly been used to attach 
              the edges of standing seam steel roof and floor deck panels, particularly those used for 
              diaphragms. The top arc seam sidelap weld connection is formed by a vertical sheet leg (edge 
              stiffener of deck) inside an overlapping sheet hem, or by two vertical sheet legs back-to-back. 
              Top arc seam welds have been referenced in some historical diaphragm design standards as part 
              of a system without defining the strength of individual connections. Similarly, AWS D1.3 has 
              shown the weld as a possible variation of an arc seam weld, without clear provisions to 
              determine weld strength. The research to develop the design provisions for the top arc seam 
              welds is presented in the S. B. Barnes Associates (Nunna and Pinkham, 2012; Nunna, et al., 
              2012) report.  
             
                J2.4.1 Shear Strength of Top Arc Seam Sidelap Welds 

                   The design limitations are due to the scope of the test program that served as the basis 
                for these provisions. The tests included typical weld spacing of approximately 12 in. (305 
                mm) o.c. and this established the strength of the welds with the stated limits. All testing 
                was performed on joints with a vertical sheet leg inside an overlapping sheet hem 
                configuration, but the behavior of connections with back-to-back vertical sheet legs is 
                assumed to be similar. 
                   Testing was performed in general accordance with AISI S905 (AISI, 2008), with the 
                specimen dimensions in S905 Table 2 modified as required to address the described deck 
                edge configuration. The ductility of the tested steels ranged from F u /F sy  = 1.01 to  
                Fu /F sy  = 1.52. The limits were extended to permit the use of the full range of recognized 
                steels. Application should be based on the specified F u /F sy  for steels recognized in Section 
                A3 of the Specification. The exclusion of the connection design restrictions for top arc seam 
                welds used in diaphragms considers that the shear in the side lap welds is flowing from the 
                sheet into each weld such that each weld is loaded as if it were a singular weld by its 
                tributary length. This mitigates the concern over load sharing in brittle connections, and the 
                strength reduction of lower ductility steels is based on the tests and built into Specification 
                Equation J2.4.1-1. 
                   The impact of shear rupture in the sheet can be calculated based on Specification Section 
                J6 and this can be used to determine minimum acceptable weld spacing. The distance from 
                the centerline of any weld and the centerline of adjacent weld can be checked by using 
                Equation C-J2.4.1-1. Equation C-J2.4.1-1 is derived by equating the nominal shear strength

                 The steel deck sheets at the sidelap need to be tightly interlocked by crimping or pinching 
              the sidelap prior to welding. When using the joint variation shown in Specification Figure 
              J2.4.1-1(b), contact must be maintained between the two vertical legs while welding. For 
              sidelaps with overlapping hem, Specification Figure J2.4.1-1(a) illustrates a crimped area 
              nominally longer than the length of fusion, and the top of the overlapping hem sidelap must 
              be burned through to allow fusion with the top of the inner vertical leg. Holes are commonly 
              present at either or both ends of the completed welds. The holes do not necessarily indicate 
              deficient welds or poor workmanship provided the specified length of fusion is obtained. 
              Holes may aid in determining proper fusion with the inner vertical leg. 
             
              J2.5  Fillet Welds 

                 For fillet welds on the lap joint specimens tested in the Cornell research (Peköz and 
              McGuire, 1979), the dimension, w 1 , of the leg on the sheet edge generally was equal to the 
              sheet thickness; the other leg, w 2 , often was two or three times longer than w 1  (see Specification 
              Figure J2.5-1). In connections of this type, the fillet weld throat is commonly larger than the 
              throat of conventional fillet welds of the same size. Usually, ultimate failure of fillet-welded 
              joints has been found to occur by the tearing of the plate adjacent to the weld (see Figure C-
              J2.5-1). 
                 In most cases, the higher strength of the weld material prevents weld shear failure; 
              therefore, the provisions of this Specification section are based on sheet tearing. Because 
              specimens up to 0.15 inch (3.81 mm) thickness were tested in the Cornell research (Peköz and 
              McGuire, 1979), the last provision in this section covers the possibility that for sections thicker 
              than 0.15 inch (3.81 mm), the throat dimension may be less than the thickness of the cover 
              plate and the tear may occur in the weld rather than in the plate material. Additional research 
              at the University of Sydney (Zhao and Hancock, 1995) has further indicated that weld throat 
              failure may even occur between the thicknesses of 0.10 in. (2.54 mm) to 0.15 in. (3.81 mm). 
              Accordingly, the Specification was revised in 2001 to require weld strength check when the 
              plate thickness is greater than 0.10 in. (2.54 mm). For high-strength materials with yield stress 
              of 65 ksi (448 MPa) or higher, research at the University of Sydney (Teh and Hancock, 2000) 
              has shown that weld throat failure does not occur in materials less than 0.10-in. (2.54-mm) 
              thick and that the Specification provisions based on sheet strength are satisfactory for high-
              strength material less than 0.10-in. (2.54-mm) thick. Prequalified fillet welds are given in 
              AWS D1.3-98 (AWS, 1998) or other equivalent weld standards.

                 In 2012, the design provisions were modified to take into consideration that the connected 
              parts may have different tensile strengths.

              J2.6  Flare Groove Welds 

                 The primary mode of failure in cold-formed steel sections welded by flare groove welds, 
              loaded transversely or longitudinally, was found to be sheet tearing along the contour of the 
              weld (see Figure C-J2.6-1). 














                                                                             
                               Figure C-J2.6-1 Flare Groove Weld Failure Modes 
                      Except for Specification Equation J2.6-4, the provisions of this Specification section are 
              intended to prevent shear tear failure. Specification Equation J2.6-4 covers the possibility that 
              thicker sections may have effective throats less than the thickness of the channel and weld 
              failure may become critical. 
                 In 2001, the Specification was revised to require that weld strength be checked when the 
              plate thickness is greater than 0.10 in. (2.54 mm) based on the research by Zhao and Hancock 
              (1995). 
                 In 2010, two figures were added showing reference dimensions for flare-bevel groove 
              welds and flare V-groove welds, respectively, which replaced the figures for these welds in 
              the previous editions of the Specification. Specification Equations J2.6-5 and J2.6-7 were added 
              to more accurately define the effective throat of these welds. Filled flush throat depths were 
              modified to match those specified in AWS D1.1-2006 Section 2.3.1.4 and Table 2.1. Welding

              process designations in Specification Tables J2.6-1 and J2.6-2 were based on AWS D1.1 Annex 
              K, where SMAW stands for “shielded metal arc welding,” FCAW-S stands for “flux cored arc

              cored arc welding-gas shielded,” and SAW stands for “submerged arc welding.” No change 
              was needed in the Specification requirements from previous editions except in the definitions 
              of the effective throat for use in Specification Equation J2.6-4. 
             
              J2.7  Resistance Welds 

                 The shear values for outside sheets of 0.125 inch (3.18 mm) or less in thickness are based 
              on “Recommended Practice for Resistance Welding Coated Low-Carbon Steels,” AWS C1.3-
              70 (Table 2.1 - Spot Welding Galvanized Low-Carbon Steel). Shear values for outside sheets 
              thicker than 0.125 inch (3.18 mm) are based upon “Recommended Practices for Resistance 
              Welding,” AWS C1.1-66 (Table 1.3 - Pulsation Welding Low-Carbon Steel) and apply to 
              pulsation welding as well as spot welding. They are applicable for all structural grades of 
              low-carbon steel, uncoated or galvanized with 0.90 oz/ft 2  (275 g/m 2 ) of sheet or less, and are 
              based on values selected from AWS C1.3-70 (Table 2.1), and AWS C1.1-66 (Table 1.3). These 
              values may also be applied to medium carbon and low-alloy steels. Spot welds in such steels 
              give somewhat higher shear strengths than those upon which these values are based; 
              however, they may require special welding conditions. In view of the fact that AWS C1.1-66 
              and AWS C1.3-70 Standards were incorporated in AWS C1.1-2000, resistance welds should be 
              performed in accordance with AWS C1.1-2000 (AWS, 2000). 
                 In the 2001 edition of the Specification, a design equation is used to determine the nominal 
              shear strength [resistance] that replaces the tabulated values given in previous editions of the 
              Specification. The upper limit of Specification Equations J2.7-1, J2.7-3 and J2.7-5 is selected to 
              best fit the data provided in AWS C1.3-70, Table 2.1 and AWS C1.1-66, Table 1.3. Shear 
              strength values for welds with the thickness of the thinnest outside sheet greater than 0.180 in. 
              (4.57 mm) have been excluded in Specification Equations J2.7-2, J2.7-4 and J2.7-6 due to the 
              thickness limit set forth in Specification Section J2. 
             
            J3 Bolted Connections 

               The structural behavior of bolted connections in cold-formed steel construction is somewhat 
            different from that in hot-rolled heavy construction, mainly because of the thinness of the 
            connected parts. Prior to 1980, the provisions included in the Specification for the design of 
            bolted connections were developed on the basis of the Cornell tests (Winter, 1956a, 1956b). These 
            provisions were updated in 1980 to reflect the results of additional research performed in the 
            United States (Yu, 1982) and to provide better coordination with the specifications of the 
            Research Council on Structural Connections (RCSC, 1980) and AISC (1978). In 1986, design 
            provisions for the maximum size of bolt holes and the allowable tension stress for bolts were 
            added to the Specification (AISI, 1986). In the 1996 edition of the Specification, minor changes to 
            the safety factors were made for computing the allowable and design tensile and shear strengths 
            [factored resistances] of bolts. The allowable tensile stress for the bolts subject to the combination 
            of shear and tension was determined by the equations provided in Specification Table J3.4-2 with 
            the applicable safety factor. 
            (a) Scope 
               Previous studies and practical experiences have indicated that the structural behavior of 
               bolted connections used for joining relatively thick cold-formed steel members is similar to

               that for connecting hot-rolled shapes and built-up members. The Specification criteria are 
               applicable only to cold-formed steel members or elements 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) or less in 
               thickness. For materials greater than 3/16 inch (4.76 mm), ANSI/AISC 360 (AISC, 2015) 
               should be used for the United States and Mexico and CSA S16 (CSA, 2014) should be used 
               for Canada.   
               Because of the lack of appropriate test data and the use of numerous surface conditions, 
               this Specification does not provide design criteria for slip-critical (also called friction-type) 
               connections. When such connections are used with cold-formed steel members where the 
               thickness of the thinnest connected part is 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) or less, it is recommended 
               that tests be conducted to confirm their design capacity. The test data should verify that the 
               specified design capacity for the connection provides sufficient safety against initial slip at 
               least equal to that implied by the provisions of ANSI/AISC 360 and CSA S16. In addition, 
               the safety against ultimate capacity should be at least equal to that implied by this 
               Specification for bearing-type connections. 
               The Specification provisions apply only when there are no gaps between plies. The 
               designer should recognize that the connection of a rectangular tubular member by means of 
               bolt(s) through such members may have less strength than if no gap existed. Structural 
               performance of connections containing unavoidable gaps between plies would require tests 
               in accordance with Specification Section K2.1. 
            (b) Materials 
               This section lists five different types of fasteners which are normally used for cold-
               formed steel construction. In view of the fact that ASTM F3125 Grades A325/A325M and 
               A490/A490M bolts are available only for diameters of 1/2 inch (12 mm) and larger, A449 
               and A354 Grade BD bolts should be used as an equivalent of ASTM F3125 Grades 
               A325/A325M and A490/A490M bolts, respectively, whenever smaller bolts (less than 1/2 
               inch (12 mm) in diameter) are required. 
               During recent years, other types of fasteners, with or without special washers, have been 
               widely used in steel structures using cold-formed steel members. The design of these 
               fasteners should be determined by tests in accordance with Section K2 of this Specification. 
            (c) Bolt Installation 
               Bolted connections in cold-formed steel structures use either mild or high-strength steel 
               bolts and are designed as a bearing-type connection. Bolt pre-tensioning is not required 
               because the ultimate strength of a bolted connection is independent of the level of bolt 
               preload. Installation must ensure that the bolted assembly will not come apart during 
               service. Experience has shown that bolts installed to a snug tight condition do not loosen or 
               “back-off” under normal building conditions and are not subject to vibration or fatigue. 
               Bolts in slip-critical connections, however, must be tightened in a manner which ensures 
               the development of the fastener tension forces required by the Research Council on 
               Structural Connections (1985 and 2000) for the particular size and type of bolts. Turn-of-nut 
               rotations specified by the Research Council on Structural Connections may not be applicable 
               because such rotations are based on larger grip lengths than those encountered in usual 
               cold-formed  steel  construction. Reduced turn-of-the-nut values would have to be 
               established for the actual combination of grip and bolt. A similar test program (RCSC, 1985 
               and 1988) could establish a cut-off value for calibrated wrenches. Direct tension indicators

               (ASTM F959), whose published clamping forces are independent of grip, can be used for 
               tightening slip-critical connections. 
            (d) Hole Sizes 
             For bolts having diameters less than 1/2 inch (12 mm), the diameter of a standard hole is the 
               diameter of bolt plus 1/32 inch (1 mm). In 2014, metric hole sizes were adjusted to whole 
               millimeters.  Hole sizes for 1 inch (24 mm) and larger bolts were increased in line with AISC 
               practices (AISC, 2015). 
               An alternative short-slotted hole size was added to Table J3 as a result of a research project 
               undertaken by Yu and Xu (2010), who investigated bolted connections having various hole 
               dimensions. 
               When using oversized holes or short-slotted holes, care must be exercised by the designer to 
               ensure that excessive deformation due to slip will not occur at working loads. Excessive 
               deformations, which can occur in the direction of the slots, may be prevented by requiring 
               bolt pretensioning. 
               Short-slotted holes are usually treated in the same manner as oversized holes. Washers or 
               back-up plates should be used over oversized or short-slotted holes in an outer ply when 
               the bolt hole deformation is considered in design. For connections using long-slotted holes, 
               Specification Section J3 requires that the washers or back-up plates be used and that the shear 
               capacity of bolts be determined by tests because a reduction in strength may be 
               encountered. 
               Design information for oversized and slotted holes is included in Section J3.3.1 because such 
               holes are often used in practice to meet dimensional tolerances during erection.  
               When the bolt hole deformation is considered in design, standard holes should be used in 
               bolted connections. Oversized holes and slotted holes are only permitted as approved by the 
               designer. An exception to the provisions for slotted holes is made in the case of slotted holes 
               in lapped and nested zees. Resistance is provided in this situation partially by the nested 
               components, rather than direct bolt shear and bearing. An oversized or slotted hole is 
               required for proper fit-up due to offsets inherent in nested parts. Research (Bryant and 
               Murray, 2001) has shown that lapped and nested zee members with 1/2-in. (12-mm) 
               diameter bolts without washers and 9/16 in. × 7/8 in. (15 mm x 23 mm) slotted holes can 
               develop the full moment in the lap. 
             
              J3.3  Bearing 

                 Previous bolted connection tests have shown that bearing strength of bolted connections 
              depends on: (1) the tensile strength, F u , of the connected parts, (2) the thickness of connected 
              parts, (3) the diameter of bolt, (4) joints with single shear and double shear conditions, (5) the 
              Fu /F y  ratio, and (6) the use of washers (Winter, 1956a and 1956b; Chong and Matlock, 1974; 
              Yu, 1982 and 2000). These design parameters were used in the 1996 and earlier editions of the 
              Specification for determining the bearing strength between bolt and connected parts (AISI, 
              1996). 
                 In the Canadian Standard (CSA, 1994), the d/t ratio was also used in the design equation 
              for determining the bearing strength of bolted connections.

                J3.3.1  Bearing Strength Without Consideration of Bolt Hole Deformation 

                   Rogers and Hancock (1998) developed the design equation for bearing of bolted 
                connections with washers (Specification Table J3.3.1-1). Based on research at the University of 
                Waterloo (Wallace, Schuster, and LaBoube, 2001a), the Rogers and Hancock equation was 
                extended to bolted connections without washers and to the inside sheet of double shear 
                connections with or without washers (Specification Table J3.3.1-2). In Specification Table 
                J3.3.1-1, the bearing factor, C, depends on the ratio of bolt diameter to member thickness, 
                d/t. The design equations in Specification Section J3.3.1 are based on available test data. 
                Thus, for sheets thinner than 0.024 in. (0.61 mm), tests must be performed to determine the 
                structural performance. 
                   The safety factor and resistance factors are based on calibration of available test data 
                (Wallace, Schuster, and LaBoube, 2001b). 
                   Yu and Xu (2010) conducted testing of bolted connections without washers on oversized 
                and short-slotted holes. Based on the test data, Yu and Xu developed new equations for 
                bearing factor, C, and new values for modification factor, m f . The hole dimensions 
                investigated in Yu and Xu (2010) are consistent with those in Table J3. The added 
                provisions for oversized and short-slotted holes do not apply to the slotted holes in lapped 
                and nested zees. The safety factor and resistance factors are verified by Yu and Xu (2010) to be 
                applicable for bolted connections using oversized and short-slotted holes. 
             
                J3.3.2 Bearing Strength With Consideration of Bolt Hole Deformation 

                   Based on research at the University of Missouri-Rolla (LaBoube and Yu, 1995), design 
                equations have been developed that recognize the presence of hole elongation prior to 
                reaching the limited bearing strength of a bolted connection. The researchers adopted an 
                elongation of 0.25 in. (6.4 mm) as the acceptable deformation limit. This limit is consistent 
                with the permitted elongation prescribed for hot-rolled steel. 
                   Since the nominal strength [resistance] value with consideration of bolt hole deformation 
                should not exceed the nominal strength [resistance] without consideration of the hole 
                deformation, this limit was added in 2004. 
             
              J3.4  Shear and Tension in Bolts 

                 The design provisions of this section are given in Section J3.4 of Appendix A or B. In 
              Appendix A, the commentary is provided for Section J3.4.                          A  
            J4 Screw Connections 

               The results of over 3500 tests worldwide were analyzed to formulate screw connection 
            provisions (Peköz, 1990). European Recommendations (1987) and British Standards (1992) were 
            considered and modified as appropriate. Since the provisions apply to many different screw 
            connections and fastener details, a greater degree of conservatism is implied than is otherwise 
            typical within this Specification. These provisions are intended for use when a sufficient number 
            of test results are not available for the particular application. A higher degree of accuracy can be 
            obtained by testing any particular connection geometry (AISI, 1992). 
               Over 450 elemental connection tests and eight diaphragm tests were conducted in which 
            compressible fiberglass insulation, typical of that used in metal building roof systems (MBMA, 
            2002), was placed between steel sheet samples in the elemental connection tests and between the

            deck and purlin in the diaphragm tests (Lease and Easterling, 2006a, 2006b). The results indicate 
            that the equations in Section J4 of the Specification are valid for applications that incorporate 6-
            3/8 in. (162 mm) or less of compressible fiberglass insulation. 
               Screw connection tests used to formulate the provisions included single fastener specimens 
            as well as multiple fastener specimens. However, it is recommended that at least two screws 
            should be used to connect individual elements. This provides redundancy against under-
            torquing, over-torquing, etc., and limits lap shear connection distortion of flat unformed 
            members such as straps. 
               Proper installation of screws is important to achieve satisfactory performance. Power tools 
            with adjustable torque controls and driving depth limitations are usually used. 
               For the convenience of designers, Table C-J4-1 gives the correlation between the common 
            number designation and the nominal diameter for screws. See Figure C-J4-1 for the 
            measurement of nominal diameters.

              J4.3  Shear 

                J4.3.1 Shear Strength [Resistance] Limited by Tilting and Bearing 

                   Screw connections loaded in shear can fail in one mode or in combination of several 
                modes. These modes are screw shear, edge tearing, tilting and subsequent pull-out of the 
                screw, and bearing of the joined materials. 
                   Tilting of the screw followed by threads tearing out of the lower sheet reduces the 
                connection shear capacity from that of the typical connection bearing strength (Figure  
                C-J4.3.1-1). 















                                                                   
                                Figure C-J4.3.1-1 Comparison of Tilting and Bearing 

                   These provisions are focused on the tilting and bearing failure modes. Two cases are 
                given depending on the ratio of thicknesses of the connected members. Normally, the head 
                of the screw will be in contact with the thinner material as shown in Figure C-J4.3.1-2. 
                However, when both members are the same thickness, or when the thicker member is in 
                contact with the screw head, tilting must also be considered as shown in Figure C-J4.3.1-3. 
                   It is necessary to determine the lower bearing capacity of the two members based on the 
                product of their respective thicknesses and tensile strengths.

                to prevent the brittle and sudden shear fracture of the screw, the Specification applies a 25 
                percent adjustment to the safety factor or the resistance factor where determined in 
                accordance with Specification Section K2.1. 
             
              J4.4  Tension 

                 Screw connections loaded in tension can fail either by the screw pulled out from the plate 
              (pull-out); material pulled over the screw head and the washer, if a washer is present (pull-
              over); or by tensile fracture of the screw. The serviceability concerns of gross distortion are 
              not covered by the equations given in Specification Section J4.4. 
                 Diameter and rigidity of the fastener head assembly as well as sheet thickness and tensile 
              strength have a significant effect on the pull-over failure load of a connection. 
                 There are a variety of washers and head styles in use. Washers must be sufficiently thick 
              to withstand bending forces with little or no deformation. In 2010, the minimum washer 
              thickness requirement of 0.050 in. (1.27 mm) was relaxed for the washers in connections where 
              t1  does not exceed 0.027 in. (0.686 mm), with the evidence that the washer thickness of as low 
              as 0.024 in. (0.610 mm) does not adversely impact the pull-over strength of the connection for 
              such top substrate thicknesses (Mujagic, 2008). In 2012, the washer dimension requirements 
              were modified to harmonize the limitations of Specification Sections J4.5 with J4.4, given 
              similar pull-over models in the two sections. Based on the findings of Zwick and LaBoube 
              (2002), washers with outside diameter of 5/8 to 3/4 in. (15.9 mm to 19.1 mm) and a minimum 
              thickness of 0.063 in. (1.60 mm) were included in the scope of Specification Section J4.4. 
              Designers should include minimum required washer thickness in project documents. 
             
                J4.4.1 Pull-Out Strength 

                   For the limit state of pull-out, Specification Equation J4.4.1-1 was derived on the basis of 
                the modified European Recommendations and the results of a large number of tests. The 
                statistic data on pull-out design considerations were presented by Peköz (1990). 
             
                J4.4.2 Pull-Over Strength 

                   For the limit state of pull-over, Specification Equation J4.4.2-1 was derived on the basis of 
                the modified British Standard and the results of a series of tests as reported by Peköz 
                (1990). In 2007, a rational allowance was included to cover the contribution of steel washers 
                beneath screw heads. For the special case of screws with domed washers (washers that are 
                not solid or do not seat flatly against the sheet metal in contact with the washer), the 
                calculated nominal pull-over strength [resistance] should not exceed 1.5t 1 d’ w Fu1  with d’ w  = 
                5/8 in. (15.9 mm). The 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) limit does not apply to solid steel washers in full 
                contact with the sheet metal. In accordance with Specification Section J4, testing is allowed 
                as an alternative method to determine fastener capacity. To use test data in design, the 
                tested material should be consistent with the design. When a polygon-shaped washer is 
                used and capacity is determined using Specification Equation J4.4.2-1, the washer should 
                have rounded corners to prevent premature tearing. 
                   In 2010, the pancake head washer screws and domed washers integral with the screw 
                head were added and defined to assist the designer in proper determination of 
                computational variables.

                J4.4.3 Tension in Screws 

                   Tensile strength of the screw fastener itself should be known and documented from 
                testing. Screw strength should be established and published by the manufacturer. In order 
                to prevent the brittle and sudden tensile fracture of the screw, the Specification applies a 25 
                percent adjustment to the safety factor or the resistance factor where determined in 
                accordance with Section K2.1. 
             
              J4.5  Combined Shear and Tension 

                 Section J4.5 checks three failure modes where shear and tension are present at a 
              connection: connection failures due to combined shear and pull-over, and combined shear and 
              pull-out, as well as screw failure in the shank due to combined shear and tension.  
             
                J4.5.1 Combined Shear and Pull-Over 

                   Research pertaining to the behavior of a screw connection has been conducted at West 
                Virginia University (Luttrell, 1999). Based on the review and analysis of West Virginia 
                University’s data for the behavior of a screw connection subject to combined shear and 
                tension (Zwick and LaBoube, 2002), equations were derived that enable the evaluation of 
                the strength of a screw connection when subjected to combined shear and tension. The tests 
                indicated that at failure, the sheet beneath the screw head pulled over the head of the 
                screw or the washer. Therefore, the nominal tensile strength [resistance] is based solely on 
                Pnov . Although both nonlinear and linear equations were developed for ease of 
                computation and because the linear equation provides regions of  V/P nv  and  T /P nov  
                equal to unity, the linear equation was adopted for the Specification. The proposed equation 
                is based on the following test program limits: 
                 0.0285 in. (0.724 mm) ≤ t 1  ≤ 0.0445 in. (1.13 mm) 
                 No. 12 and No. 14 self-drilling screws with or without washers 
                 d w  ≤ 0.75 in. (19.1 mm) 
                 62 ksi (427 MPa or 4360 kg/cm 2 ) ≤ F u1  ≤ 70.7 ksi (487 MPa or 4970 kg/cm 2 ) 
                 t 2  / t 1  ≥ 2.5 
                   The limit t 2  / t 1  ≥ 2.5 reflects the fact that the test program (Luttrell, 1999) focused on 
                connections having sheet thicknesses that precluded the tilting limit state from occurring. 
                Thus, this limit ensures that the design equations will only be used when tilting limit state 
                is not the controlling limit state. 
                   The standard washer with outside diameter of 3/4 in. (19.1 mm) has a minimum 
                thickness of 0.063 in. (1.60 mm). In 2011, the washer dimension limitations of Specification 
                Sections J4.4 and J4.5 were harmonized, given similar pull-over models in the two sections. 
                   The linear form of the equation as adopted by the Specification is similar to the 
                following more conservative linear design equation that has been used by engineers: 
                  V/P nv  + T /P nov  ≤ 1.0                                              C-J4.5.1-1 
                See Specification Section J4.5.1 for the definitions of the variables. 
                   An eccentric load on a clip connection may create a nonuniform stress distribution 
                around the fastener. For example, tension tests on roof panel welded connections have 
                shown that under an eccentrically applied tension force, the resulting connection capacity is 



             
                             This document is copyrighted by AISI. Any redistribution is prohibited.            142                                                    Chapter J, Connections and Joints 


                50 percent of the tension capacity under a uniformly applied tension force. Thus, the 
                Specification stipulates that the nominal pull-over strength [resistance] shall be taken as 50 
                percent of P nov . If the eccentric load is applied by a rigid member such as a clip, the 
                resulting tension force on the screw may be uniform; thus the force in the screw can be 
                determined by mechanics, and the capacity of the fastener should be reliably estimated by 
                Pnov . Based on the field performance of screw-attached panels, the 30 percent reduction 
                associated with welds at sidelaps need not be applied when evaluating the strength of 
                sidelap screw connections at supports or for sheet-to-sheet. The reduction is due to 
                transverse prying or peeling. It is acceptable to apply the 50 percent reduction at panel 
                ends due to longitudinal prying. 
             
                J4.5.2 Combined Shear and Pull-Out 

                   Research pertaining to the behavior of a screw connection has been conducted at the 
                Missouri University of Science and Technology (Francka and LaBoube, 2010). Based on the 
                findings of this research, equations were derived that enable the evaluation of the strength 
                of a screw connection when subjected to combined shear and tension. The tests indicated 
                that at failure, the screw pulled out of the bottom sheet of the connection. Therefore, the 
                nominal tensile strength [resistance] is based solely on the tilting and tearing failure mode, 
                Specification Equation J4.5.2-2. Although both nonlinear and linear equations were 
                developed, the reliability of the nonlinear and linear equations was comparable. Therefore, 
                for ease of computation, the linear equation was adopted for the Specification. The proposed 
                equation is based on the test program limits as defined in the Specification. Evaluation of 
                the connection for the combined shear and pull-out does not negate the need to evaluate the 
                shear alone and pull-out alone limit states. 
             
                J4.5.3 Combined Shear and Tension in Screws  

                   In 2012, new provisions were added to account for shear and tension interaction in 
                screws. Based on the rational engineering analysis, the same strength interaction as that used 
                for bolts, Specification Equations J3.4-2 (ASD) and J3.4-3 (LRFD and LSD) (but in a different 
                form) are used for screws. 
             
            J5 Power-Actuated Fastener (PAF) Connections 

               In 2012, Section J5 was added to address connections with power-actuated fasteners (PAFs) 
            connecting steel elements in non-diaphragm applications. These provisions do not preclude 
            evaluation of any limit state on any power-actuated fastener through manufacturer or independent 
            laboratory testing. The safety and resistance factors for any nominal strength [resistance] established 
            through testing should be determined using provisions of Section K2 of the Specification.  
               In Specification Section J5, the provisions for determining the available strengths [factored 
            resistances] were developed based on the study by Mujagic et al. (2010). Applicability constraints 
            of these provisions correspond to the limitations of data available in the study (Mujagic et al., 
            2010). 
               In the provisions, the term “near side of the embedment material” refers to the surface of the 
            embedment material from which the PAF is driven. The term “far side of the embedment 
            material” refers to the embedment material surface from which the driven fastener exits.

              J5.1  Minimum Spacing, Edge and End Distances 

                 The minimum center-to-center spacing of the PAFs and the edge distances in the 
              Specification are those stipulated by Table 2 of ASTM E1190 (ASTM, 2008). While larger 
              spacing and edge distances are frequently found in test reports, the minimum distances given 
              in ASTM E1190 (ASTM, 2008) are deemed sufficient in eliminating the detrimental effects of 
              inadequate edge distance or fastener grouping.  
             
              J5.2  Power-Actuated Fasteners (PAFs) in Tension 

                 Applicable limit states in tension include tension fracture, pull-out, and pull-over. The 
              determination of available strength [factored resistance] due to any particular limit state for the 
              fasteners depicted in Specification Figure J5 should be accomplished through appropriate 
              testing. Alternatively, the available strength [factored resistance] should be determined using 
              Sections J5.2.1 through J5.2.3 of the Specification.  
             
                J5.2.1 Tension Strength of Power-Actuated Fasteners (PAFs) 

                   Power-actuated fasteners (PAFs) typically possess the Rockwell hardness (HRC) values of 
                49 to 58. Adequate HRC values represent one of the most critical design, installation and 
                behavioral features of PAFs. The HRC values can be properly related to tensile strength in 
                most ranges of HRC. The study by Mujagic et al. (2010) showed that the nominal tensile 
                fracture strength [resistance] can be determined using the value of 260,000 psi (1790 MPa) for 
                the HRC range in excess of 52. The user is cautioned to distinguish between the strength 
                properties and HRC of pre-hardened steel from which a fastener is made and those of the 
                hardened steel representing the final fastener product. 
                   Specification Equation J5.2.1-1 was developed with the PAF driven such that no part of 
                the length, dp , as illustrated in Specification Figure J5, is located above the near side of the 
                embedment material.  
             
                J5.2.2 Pull-Out Strength  

                   The nominal pull-out strength [resistance] of power-actuated fasteners (PAFs) greatly 
                depends on minute metallurgical, geometric, installation, and other design (often 
                proprietary) features. PAFs develop their pull-out strength through partial fusion to the 
                embedment material and friction resulting from the confinement stresses imposed by the 
                displaced embedment material. Mechanical interlock or keying with PAF shank knurling 
                and brazing effects due to zinc plating of the PAF also contribute to strength. While 
                various behavioral trends can be established, it is not possible to develop a generic 
                prediction model for PAFs which captures the above-mentioned, often proprietary, specific 
                design features. Consequently, it was decided to stipulate testing as the only viable method 
                of determining the pull-out strength. This approach is similar to how the pull-out strength 
                is addressed in the EN 1993-1-3 (CEN 2006). The currently available testing protocols for 
                determining the pull-out strength are given in AISI S905 (AISI, 2013) and ASTM E1190 
                (ASTM, 2011). 
                   The tabulated nominal pull-out strengths [resistances] in Table C-J5.2.2-1 are provided for 
                informational purposes. The table is extracted from the study by Mujagic et al. (2010), and 
                it represents lower bound values from a limited selection of industry fastener and 
                embedment plate combinations available to the study. Table C-J5.2.2-1 is only applicable to

                fasteners embedded in steel plate for which manufacturer applicability guidelines stipulate 
                embedment condition whereby no part of the length, dp , of PAF point, as illustrated in 
                Specification Figure J5, is located above the near side of the embedment material. The values 
                in Table C-J5.2.2-1 were scaled such that a safety factor of 3.0 computed in accordance with 
                Section K2 of the Specification can be justified for the nominal strength [resistance] value of 
                each of the considered fasteners. Since these are lower bound solutions, the actual safety 
                factor for some of the fasteners would be higher than 3.0. The table is only applicable to 
                fastener types and geometries depicted in Specification Figure J5. The current design 
                practice generally involves reliance on tested capacities established per International Code 
                Council Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) Acceptance Criteria 70 (AC70) (ICC-ES, 2010). The 
                AC70 stipulates a minimum safety factor of 5.0, thus in many cases resulting in lower 
                allowable strength values than those implied by Table C-J5.2.2-1. The approaches for 
                establishing the safety factor stipulated by Section K2 of the Specification and by ICC-ES 
                AC70 are not consistent. However, the values in Table C-J5.2.2-1 can be conservatively 
                related to the current practice by reducing the nominal strength [resistance] values given 
                therein by a factor of 0.6 (i.e., 3/5).

                manufacturer, a safety factor of 4.0 and a resistance factor of 0.40 (0.35 for LSD) can be applied 
                to the nominal strengths [resistance] provided in Table C-J5.2.2-1. This option was provided 
                based on the study by Mujagic et al. (2010) which shows that 4.0 represents a conservative 
                lower bound value of safety factor for a variety of fastener types and models when the 
                computed safety factor or data required for its computation is not available to the user. 
             
                J5.2.3 Pull-Over Strength 

                   The pull-over limit state in PAF connections is fundamentally the same as that in screw 
                connections. The Specification addresses the screw-like PAFs in an identical manner that 
                screw connections are dealt with in Specification Section J4. The two notable exceptions 
                represent connections with tapered-head fasteners that consistently yield about 20 percent 
                lower pull-over strength than screw-like PAF connections, and connections with collapsible 
                spring washers that consistently yield about 30 percent higher strength than screw-like 
                PAF connections. The Specification addresses the two special cases by varying the constant 
                multiplier of the pull-over equation. 
             
              J5.3  Power-Actuated Fasteners (PAFs) in Shear 

                 Applicable limit states in shear are shear fracture, bearing and tilting, pull-out, net section 
              checks, and nominal shear strength [resistance] limited by edge distance.

                J5.3.1 Shear Strength of Power-Actuated Fasteners (PAFs) 

                   Nominal shear strength [resistance] of PAFs is determined by relating the ultimate tensile 
                strength in tension to that in shear by a factor of 0.6.  
             
                J5.3.2 Bearing and Tilting Strength 

                   The nominal bearing strength [resistance] is based on the equation proposed in the study 
                by Mujagic et al. (2010) based on the data for which t 2 /t 1  ≥ 2.0 and t 2  ≥ 1/8 in. (3.2 mm). 
                While some decrease in calculated strength was observed with decreasing t 2 /t 1  ratio, thus 
                suggesting the presence of tilting at lower ratios of t 2 /t 1 , it was noted that the bearing and 
                tilting strength can be predicted by setting the constant multiplier in the bearing equation 
                to 3.7. Since the study by Mujagic et al. (2010) was based only on the types of fasteners 
                shown in Specification Figures J5(c) and J5(d), the ENV 1993-1-3 (ECS, 2006) equation 
                constant of 3.2 is conservatively adopted for other types of PAFs.  
             
                J5.3.3 Pull-Out Strength in Shear  

                   Pull-out in shear is essentially a derivative of fastener tilting in steel. The pull-out 
                failures were reported at wide range of t 2 /t 1  ratios. The bearing strength equation of 
                Specification Section J5.3.2 considers the effect of tilting deformation on bearing failures at 
                low ratios of t 2 /t 1 . However, as expected, it does not accurately predict the connection 
                strength where tilting is the predicted failure mode. The Specification, therefore, stipulates a 
                separate pull-out check over the entire range of t 2 /t 1  ratios and thicknesses covered by the 
                Specification.  
             
                J5.3.4 Net Section Rupture Strength 

                   Based on the recommendations of Beck and Engelhardt (2002), the PAF hole is required 
                to be calculated based on a width of 1.10 times the PAF diameter. The effect of partially 
                driven PAFs (i.e., where the PAF point length, dp , is fully or partially located in the 
                embedment material) on net section properties of a connection are not presently known. 
                The Specification, therefore, stipulates that the PAF shank diameter, d s , be used in 
                determination of net section properties. 
             
                J5.3.5 Shear Strength Limited by Edge Distance 

                   The Specification presently stipulates the application of the same criteria given for 
                screws in Specification Section J6.1, recognizing fundamental similarities in behavior and 
                application of screw and PAF connections. Favorable local effects of sheath folding and local 
                hardening of the sheathing near the PAF hole may render the screw connection criteria 
                slightly conservative when applied to PAF connections. The effect of partially driven PAFs 
                (i.e., where the PAF point length, dp , is fully or partially located in the embedment 
                material) on edge distance properties of a connection are not presently known. The 
                Specification, therefore, stipulates that the PAF shank diameter, d s , be used in edge distance 
                checks. 
             
              J5.4  Combined Shear and Tension 

                 Combined shear and tension in the PAF connection should include the interaction of

              combined shear and pull-over, combined shear and pull-out, and fracture due to combined 
              shear and tension on the PAF fastener itself. Currently available research does not address 
              PAF connections subject to combined tension and shear. Consequently, the Specification does 
              not at present provide equations for consideration of such connections. The ICC-ES AC 70 
              (ICC-ES, 2010) criteria can be used to consider combined tension and shear through testing. 
              Alternatively, such a condition can be evaluated in accordance with Specification Section A1.2. 
              Based upon fundamental principles of fastener mechanics, Equation C-J5.4-1 represents an 
              exact interaction between tension and shear when fastener fracture governs. Since the actual 
              interaction curve is not presently known for other combinations of tension and shear limit 
              states, the power coefficient of one, rendering the Equation C-J5.4-1 a linear interaction, can be 
              used as a conservative check when both shear and tension are not limited by fracture.

            J6 Rupture 

               The provisions contained in Specification Section J6 and its subsections are applicable only 
            when the thinnest connected part is 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) or less in thickness. For materials 
            thicker than 3/16 inch (4.76 mm), the design should follow ANSI/AISC 360 for the United 
            States and Mexico and CSA S16 for Canada.                                      
             
               Significant changes were made to the format of Specification Section J6 in 2010. Connections 
            may be subject to shear rupture, tension rupture, block failure in tension, block failure, or any 
            combinations of these failures in shear depending upon the relationship of the connectors to the 
            connection geometry and loading direction. Specification Table J6.2-1 provides adjustment factors 
            consistent with prior editions of the Specification to cover shear lag factors. Other adjustment 
            factors provide allowances for staggered connector patterns and nonuniform stress distribution 
            on the tensile plane. In 2012, the Committee added a reference to PAFs in Table J6-1, permitting 
            the use of the same safety and resistance factors as for screws. This step was taken recognizing 
            inherent similarities in configurations and behavior of screw and PAF connections as they relate 
            to net fracture of connected elements. Furthermore, partial fusion occurring between the 
            embedment steel and PAF should result in a conservative design with respect to application of 
            resistance and safety factors for screw connections. 
            (a) Shear Lag for Flat Sheet Connections 
               Earlier tests showed that for flat sheet connections using a single bolt or a single row having 
            multiple bolts perpendicular to the force (Chong and Matlock, 1975; Carill, LaBoube and Yu, 
            1994), the joint rotation and out-of-plane deformation of flat sheets are excessive. Consequently,

            specific shear lag factors were developed. However, it was found by Teh and Gilbert (2014) that, 
            for the limit state of net section tension rupture, there is no noticeable difference in the shear lag 
            factors between different types of bolted connections. The apparent differences in the shear lag 
            factors “due to joint rotation and out-of-plane deformation of flat sheets” cited in the earlier 
            Specification edition were actually due to a different failure mode, namely tilt bearing failure, 
            which is considered separately. For flat sheet connections using multiple connectors in the line of 
            force and having less out-of-plane deformations, the strength reduction was not required in the 
            2012 edition of the Specification (Rogers and Hancock, 1998). A single shear lag reduction factor 
            given by Specification Equation J6.2-4 (Teh and Gilbert, 2014) now applies to all cases (both 
            single and multiple bolts in the line of the force, and single and double shear connections) in the 
            2016 edition of the Specification. 
            (b) Staggered Holes 
               The presence of staggered or diagonal hole patterns in a bolted connection has long been 
            recognized as increasing the net section area for the limit state of rupture. It was first analytically 
            studied by Cochrane (1922), who derived the adjustment term s' 2 /(4g + 2d h ) shown in 
            Specification Equation J6.2-3. LaBoube and Yu (1995) summarized the findings of a limited study 
            of the behavior of bolted connections having staggered hole patterns. The research showed that 
            when a staggered hole pattern is present, the width of a rupture plane could be adjusted by use 
            of s′2 /4g with an additional 10 percent reduction factor. More recent testing on the critical 
            tensile path involving stagger has been carried out by Fox and Schuster (2010), the results of 
            which indicate that the 10 percent reduction is not required. However, the neglect of the 
            variable involving the bolt hole diameter, d h , in the earlier Specification edition was not required, 
            as it did not lead to meaningful simplification while potentially leading to 10 percent 
            overestimation (Teh & Gilbert, 2014).  Consequently, d h  was included in Equation J6.2-3 of the 
            2016 edition of the Specification. 
            (c) Shear Lag for Other Than Flat Sheet Connections 
               Shear lag has a debilitating effect on the tensile capacity of a cross-section. Based on the 
            University of Missouri-Rolla research (LaBoube and Yu, 1995), design equations have been 
            developed that can be used to estimate the influence of the shear lag. The research 
            demonstrated that the shear lag effect differs for an angle and a channel. For both cross-sections, 
            however, the key parameters that influence shear lag are the distance from the shear plane to 
            the center of gravity of the cross-section and the length of the connection (See Figures C-J6-1 and 
            C-J6-2). The research by Teh and Gilbert (2014) has shown that the shear lag factors for bolted

            connections in angle and channel members should take into account the width ratio between 
            the connected and the unconnected parts, in addition to the traditional ratio between the 
            connection eccentricity,  x, and the connection length, L. Specification Equations J6.2-6 and J6.2-8 
            developed by Teh and Gilbert (2014) lead to accurate results for bolted connections in angle and 
            channel members of various configurations and material properties. Additionally, there are no 
            artificial lower or upper bound values for the computed shear lag factors. 
               Research has also shown that for cold-formed steel sections using single-bolt connections, 
            bearing usually controlled the nominal strength [resistance], not rupture in the net section. 
            (d) Block Shear 
               Block shear is a limit state in which the resistance is determined by the sum of the shear 
            strength on a failure path(s) parallel to the force and the tensile strength on the segment(s) 
            perpendicular to the force. A comprehensive test program does not exist regarding block shear 
            for cold-formed steel members. However, a limited study conducted at the University of 
            Missouri-Rolla indicates that the AISC equations may be applied to cold-formed steel members.  
               Block shear is a rupture or tearing phenomenon, not a yielding limit state. However, gross 
            yielding on the shear plane can occur when tearing on the tensile plane. Specification Equations 
            J6.3-1 and J6.3-2 check both conditions. 
               Connection tests conducted by Birkemoe and Gilmor (1978) have shown that on coped 
            beams, a tearing failure mode as shown in Figure C-J6-5 can occur along the perimeter of the 
            holes. Hardash and Bjorhovde (1985) have demonstrated these effects for tension members as 
            illustrated in Figure C-J6-4. The research paper “AISC LRFD Rules for Block Shear in Bolted 
            Connections – A Review” (Kulak and Grondin, 2001) provides a summary of test data for block 
            shear rupture strength.  
               The distribution of tensile stresses is not always uniform (Ricles and Yura, 1983; Kulak and 
            Grondin, 2001). For shear forces on coped beams, an additional multiplier, U bs , of 0.5 is used 
            when more than one row of bolts is present. This approach is consistent with the provisions of 
            ANSI/AISC 360 (AISC, 2005 and 2010a).  
               Tests performed at the University at Missouri-Rolla have indicated that the current design 
            equations for shear and tilting provide a reasonably good estimate of the connection 
            performance for multiple screws in a pattern (LaBoube and Sokol, 2002).

            J7 Connections to Other Materials 

               When a cold-formed steel structural member is connected to other materials, such as hot-rolled 
            steel, aluminum, concrete, masonry or wood, the connection strength should be the smallest of 
            the strength of the fastener, the strength of the fastener attachment to the cold-formed steel 
            structural member, or the strength of the fastener attachment to the other material.  
             
              J7.1  Connection Strength to Other Materials 

                 The design of connections to other materials should be in accordance with the applicable 
              building code, including those referenced standards, as applicable. When the applicable building 
              code provides no requirement with respect to consideration of specific limit states, other codes 
              and standards and manufacturers’ technical reports and catalogues acceptable to the authority 
              having jurisdiction may be utilized. The following is a list of suggested references:

              J7.2  Power-Actuated Fasteners (PAFs) in Concrete 

                 In 2016, provisions were added to Specification Section J7.2 for power-actuated fasteners 
              (PAFs) connecting cold-formed steel framing track-to-concrete base materials. These 
              provisions are based on an experimental study where cold-formed steel wall tracks were 
              attached to concrete base materials and subjected to monotonic and cyclic/seismic test loads 
              (AISI, 2013h). The experimental data demonstrated that residual monotonic shear strength of 
              power-actuated fastener connections after cyclic/seismic loading closely matched the reference 
              monotonic shear strength.  
                 The experimental data further demonstrated that ductile steel failure modes limit the 
              capacity of the connection with thinner cold-formed steel track. Where this failure mode is 
              dominant, the use of Specification Section J5.3.2 to determine the strength of cold-formed steel 
              track connection is appropriate. For thicker track, the limit state was pull-out of the fastener in 
              shear. Figure C-J7.2-1 illustrates the connection failure of the power-actuated fastener pull-out 
              (pry-out) in shear. The nominal value of P nos  = 1,450 lbs (6,450 N) is given by Specification 
              Section J7.2.2. This nominal value is based on tests with normalweight concrete as specified in 
              ACI 318 for the United States and Mexico and in CAN/CSA A23.3 for Canada with the 
              minimum specified concrete strength of 2.5 ksi (17.2 MPa). The nominal value is considered 
              as a lower bound strength based on the concrete strength used in the test program. Where 
              justified in manufacturers’ evaluation reports or test data that the shear strength of PAF in 
              lightweight concrete is equivalent to normalweight concrete, this nominal value may be 
              extended to the following applications: 
              (a) For the United States and Mexico: Sand-lightweight concrete, as specified in ACI 318, 
                 with a minimum specified concrete strength of 3.0 ksi (20.7 MPa) and a minimum 
                 embedment at 1 in. (25.4 mm); and 
              (b) For Canada: Structural low-density concrete, as specified in CAN/CSA A23.3, with a 
                 minimum specified concrete strength of 20 MPa and a minimum embedment at 25 mm.  
                 Industry installation guidelines recommend that the thickness of the concrete base 
              material, d c , should be greater than or equal to three times the PAF embedment, h ET .

            K1 Test Standards 

               Specification Section K1 lists standards developed for testing cold-formed steel elements, 
            connections, or assemblies. Commentaries are provided along with the test standards as needed. 
             
            K2 Tests for Special Cases  

               All tests for: (1) the determination and confirmation of structural performance, and (2) the 
            determination of mechanical properties must be made by an independent testing laboratory or 
            by a manufacturer’s testing laboratory. The design and testing of cold-formed steel diaphragms 
            should be in accordance with the standards specified in Specification Section I2. Accordingly, the 
            statement that the provisions in Specification Section K2 do not apply to cold-formed steel 
            diaphragms was deleted in 2016. 
             
              K2.1 Tests for Determining Structural Performance 

                 This Specification section contains provisions for proof of structural adequacy by load tests. 
              This section is restricted to those cases permitted under Section A1.2 of the Specification or 
              specifically permitted elsewhere in the Specification. 
             
                K2.1.1 Load and Resistance Factor Design and Limit States Design 

                   The determination of load-carrying capacity of the tested elements, assemblies, 
                connections, or members is based on the same procedures used to calibrate the LRFD design 
                criteria, for which the φ factor can be computed from Specification Equation K2.1.1-2 as 
                developed in the Commentary as Equation C-B3.2.2-15. 
                   The calibration coefficient, C φ , and coefficient of variation of the load effect, V Q , are 
                dependent on the selected load combination and load ratio (e.g., dead-to-live load ratio). 
                Justification for the selected choices is provided in Commentary Sections B3.2.2 and B3.2.3. If 
                the special case being considered deviates significantly from the assumed governing load 
                combination (1.2D +1.6L in the United States and 1.25D+1.5L in Canada) or dead-to-live 
                load ratio (1:5 in the United States and 1:3 in Canada), then updated values such as those 
                provided in Meimand and Schafer (2014) for C φ  and V Q  may be considered. With the 
                exception of earthquake load combinations, the constant values for C φ  and V Q  that the 
                Specification provides were shown to result in φ factors within 15 percent of more exact 
                approximations (Meimand and Schafer, 2014). 
                   The correction factor, C P , is used in Specification Equation K2.1.1-2 for determining the 
                φ factor to account for the influence due to a small number of tests (Peköz and Hall, 1988b 
                and Tsai, 1992). It should be noted that when the number of tests is large enough, the effect 
                of the correction factor is negligible. In the 1996 edition of the Specification, Equation K2.1.1-
                4 was revised because the old formula for C P  could be unconservative for combinations of 
                a high V P  and a small sample size (Tsai, 1992). This revision enables the reduction of the 
                minimum number of tests from four to three identical specimens. Consequently, the ±10 
                percent deviation limit was relaxed to ±15 percent. The use of C P  with a minimum V P  
                reduces the need for this restriction. In Specification Equation K2.1.1-4, a numerical value of 
                CP  = 5.7 was found for n = 3 by comparison with a two-parameter method developed by 
                Tsai (1992). It is based on the given value of V Q  and other statistics listed in Specification

                Table K2.1.1-1, assuming that V P  will be no larger than about 0.20. The requirements of 
                Specification Section K2.1.1(a) for n = 3 help to ensure this outcome.  
                   The 0.065 minimum value of V P , when used in Specification Equation K2.1.1-2 for the 
                case of three tests, produces safety factors similar to those of the 1986 edition of the AISI 
                ASD Specification, i.e., approximately 2.0 for members and 2.5 for connections. The LRFD 
                calibration reported by Hsiao, Yu and Galambos (1988a) indicates that V P  is almost always 
                greater than 0.065 for common cold-formed steel components, and can sometimes reach 
                values of 0.20 or more. The minimum value for V P  helps to prevent potential 
                unconservatism compared to values of V P  implied in LRFD design criteria. 
                   In evaluating the coefficient of variation VP  from test data, care must be taken to use 
                the coefficient of variation for a sample. This can be calculated as follows: 

                        s2
                  VP  =                                                            C-K2.1.1-1  Rn
                    where 
                    s2    = Sample variance of all test results 
                          1  n
                       =      ∑ ( ) RR     2
                            1n           ni −                                              C-K2.1.1-2  −  1i=
                    Rn   = Mean of all test results 
                    Ri   = Test result i of n total results 
                   Alternatively, V P  can be calculated as the sample standard deviation of n ratios R i /R n . 
                   If the nominal strength [resistance] is determined in accordance with a rational engineering 
                analysis while the safety and resistance factors are calculated based on tests, the coefficient of 
                variation, V P , is determined in accordance with Specification Equation K2.1.1-6 with P m  
                determined in accordance with Specification Equation K2.1.1-3.  
                   For beams having tension flange through-fastened to deck or sheathing and with 
                compression flange laterally unbraced (subject to wind uplift), the calibration is based on a 
                load combination of 1.17W-0.9D with D/W = 0.1 (see Section I6.2.1 of this Commentary for 
                detailed discussion). 
                   The additional statistical data needed for the determination of the resistance factor are 
                listed in Specification Table K2.1.1-1. Table K2.1.1-1 was simplified and updated in 2016 to 
                reflect current limit states, to provide clarity in its use for rational engineering analysis and 
                test-based methods, and to reflect the actual accuracy of the selected M m , V M , F m , and V F  
                statistics. The original basis for the Table K2.1.1-1 member statistics is the LRFD calibration 
                of Hsiao, Yu and Galambos (1988a). Connection statistics are based on Rang, Galambos, and 
                Yu (1979b) and Peköz (1990). Values for power-actuated fasteners are based on Mujagic et al. 
                (2010). The statistics data for connections to structural concrete and wood are based on 
                those employed in AISI S310. In 2007, the Specification more clearly defined the appropriate 
                material properties that are to be used when evaluating test results by specifying that 
                supplier-provided properties are not to be used. 
                   In 2012, statistical data of M m , V M , F m , and V F  were added for power-actuated fasteners 
                to accompany the newly created Specification Section J5, based on the study by Mujagic et 
                al. (2010). 
                   In 2012, Section K2.1.1(c) was revised to permit the use of mill certificates to establish

                the mechanical properties of small connectors and devices. As a general practice, the yield 
                stress, F y , is determined by testing a tensile specimen that is either cut from the test 
                specimen, or the steel coil or sheet used to produce the test specimen. However, for some 
                cold-formed steel components such as small hurricane ties and clips, it is often impossible 
                to cut a standard size or sub-size tensile specimen that would meet the requirements of 
                ASTM A370 (ASTM, 2015). Since mill certificate tensile specimens are taken from the lead 
                or tail of the master coil which may not be representative of the entire coil, and because 
                coiling and uncoiling operations can alter mechanical properties, it is necessary to reduce 
                Mm . When using mill certificates instead of tensile specimens for a range of 21 coils 
                (Stauffer and McEntee, 2012), it has been shown that using M m  = 0.85 will provide 
                corresponding φ and Ω values that are on average 15 percent more conservative. In order 
                to use mill certificates to establish material properties, it is important to maintain proper 
                records and procedures that can trace the connector or device to the master coil. The use of 
                mill certificates is not permitted for members. In addition, although mill certificates are 
                routinely used to establish the raw material properties for fasteners such as screws or 
                power-actuated fasteners, they should not be used to establish the final material properties. 
                This is because the raw steel undergoes secondary operations such as heat treating that 
                alters its final properties. 
                   In 2012, Section A1.2(b) and Section K2.1.1(b) were added as an optional method to 
                calibrate safety and resistance factors for a proposed strength theory using test data. In order 
                to use this optional method, sufficient correlation must exist between the proposed 
                strength theory and the test data. The correlation coefficient, C c , used in this section is a 
                statistical measure of the agreement between the strength predictions (R n,i ) and test results 
                (R t,i ):

                                              RnRRn                          ∑∑∑∑ 2         2      2          2i,t  −     i,t          i,n  −  R i,n
                    where 
                    Rt,i  = Tested strength [resistance], corresponding to test i  
                    Rn,i  = Predicted nominal strength [resistance], corresponding to test i. 
                   The value of the correlation coefficient reveals information about the potential quality 
                of the proposed strength theory, namely: 
                (1) High or moderately high positive correlation indicates that the theory and tests either 
                   agree substantially as they are, or can be brought into good agreement by using a 
                   constant factor. This means that bias factor, P m , will compensate for the bias, as 
                   intended, in the calibration procedure to determine the resistance factor.  
                (2) Low or nearly zero correlation is an indicator of independence; in other words, no 
                   relationship between the tests and theory can be discerned. Using the theory will 
                   produce bad results and it should be rejected. 
                (3) Negative correlation indicates that the theory and test data not only disagree but 
                   actually have opposite relationships. For example, when the theory says the strength 
                   increases, it actually decreases. Using the theory will produce bad results and it should 
                   be rejected. 
                   The square of the correlation coefficient is referred to as the coefficient of

                determination. It gives the proportion of the variance (fluctuation) of one variable (tested 
                strength [resistance]) that is predicted by the other variable (strength theory). For example, 
                for C c2  = (0.8) 2 , 64 percent of the variance is accounted for by the theory. Alternative values 
                for the minimum correlation coefficient could be used, but values above C c  = 0.707 have 
                the desirable characteristic that C c2  ≥ 0.5; that is, more than 50 percent of the variance is 
                explained by the theory.  
                   In general, higher values of the correlation coefficient are desirable, and indicate a 
                better agreement with the theory, lower V P , and a better result for the product of the 
                resistance factor times the nominal strength [resistance] given by the theory.  
                   Another advantage of a correlation coefficient criterion is that it is less restrictive and 
                easier to satisfy than alternative criteria based on individual deviations, such as a 15 
                percent deviation restriction. C c  is obtained from the full data set and does not apply to 
                individual values. Also, there are multiple ways to obtain a good correlation coefficient. 
                For example, if the test data and strength theory differ by a constant factor; i.e., they are 
                proportional, one will still get a correlation coefficient of 1.0, as if they had agreed directly. 
                This advantage also holds for moderately high correlation coefficients. As mentioned 
                above, this will improve the effectiveness of bias factor, P m , and the resistance factor. 
                   It is important that users not only test at the upper and lower bounds of the desired 
                parameter range, but that even coverage of tests is provided throughout the range. This is 
                emphasized in the Specification in order to ensure that potential minima or maxima within 
                the test range are detected and that the resistance factor and safety factor calibrated using the 
                test data properly reflect any variation from the minima/maxima. 
                   The Specification provides methods for determining the deflection of some members for 
                serviceability consideration, but the Specification does not provide serviceability limits. 
                Justification is discussed in Section B3.7 of the Commentary. 
             
                K2.1.2 Allowable Strength Design 

                   The equation for the safety factor, Ω (Specification Equation K2.1.2-2), converts the 
                resistance factor, φ, from LRFD test procedures in Specification Section K2.1.1 to an equivalent 
                safety factor for the Allowable Strength Design. The average of the test results, R n , is then 
                divided by the safety factor to determine an allowable strength. It should be noted that 
                Specification Equation K2.1.2-2 is identical with Equation C-B3.2.2-16 for D/L = 0. 
             
              K2.2 Tests for Confirming Structural Performance 

                 Members, connections and assemblies that can be designed according to the provisions of 
              Chapters A through J, L, and M of the Specification need no confirmation of calculated results 
              by test. However, special situations may arise where it is desirable to confirm the results of 
              calculations by test. Tests may be called for by the manufacturer, the engineer, or a third 
              party. 
                 Since design is in accordance with the Specification, all that is needed is for the tested 
              specimen or assembly to demonstrate that the strength is not less than the applicable nominal 
              resistance, R n .

              K2.3 Tests for Determining Mechanical Properties 

                K2.3.1 Full Section 

                   Explicit methods for utilizing the effects of cold work are incorporated in Section A3.3.2 
                of the Specification. In that section, it is specified that as-formed mechanical properties, in 
                particular the yield stress, can be determined either by full-section tests or by calculating the 
                strength of the corners and computing the weighted average for the strength of corners 
                and flats. The strength of flats can be taken as the virgin strength of the steel before 
                forming, or can be determined by special tension tests on specimens cut from flat portions 
                of the formed cross-section. This Specification section spells out in considerable detail the 
                types and methods of these tests, and their number as required for use in connection with 
                Specification Section A3.3.2. For details of testing procedures which have been used for such 
                purposes, but which in no way should be regarded as mandatory, see Specification (1968), 
                Chajes, Britvec and Winter (1963), and Karren (1967). AISI S902, Stub-Column Test Method 
                for Effective Area of Cold-Formed Steel Columns, provides testing procedures (AISI, 2013c). 
             
                K2.3.2 Flat Elements of Formed Sections 

                   Specification Section K2.3.2 provides the basic requirements for determining the 
                mechanical properties of flat elements of formed sections. These tested properties are to be 
                used in Specification Section A3.3.2 for calculating the average yield stress of the formed 
                section by considering the strength increase from cold work of forming. 
             
                K2.3.3 Virgin Steel 

                   For steels other than the ASTM Specifications listed in Specification Section A3.1, the 
                tensile properties of the virgin steel used for calculating the increased yield stress of the 
                formed section should also be determined in accordance with the Standard Methods of 
                ASTM A370 (2015).

            L. DESIGN FOR SERVICEABILITY (I eff ) 

               Reduced stiffness values used in the direct analysis method, described in Chapter C, are not 
            intended for use with the provisions of this chapter. 
             
            L1 Serviceability Determination for Effective Width Method 

               The effective moment of inertia is calculated based on the reduced cross-section at the service 
            load level. Examples are provided in the Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013). 
             
            L2 Serviceability Determination for Direct Strength Method 

               The provisions of this section use a simplified approach to deflection calculations that 
            assume the moment of inertia of the section for deflection calculations is linearly proportional to 
            the strength of the section, determined at the allowable stress of interest. This approximation 
            avoids lengthy effective section calculations for deflection determination. 
             
            L3 Flange Curling 

               In beams which have unusually wide and thin, but stable flanges (i.e., primarily tension 
            flanges with large w/t ratios), there is a tendency for these flanges to curl under bending. That is, 
            the portions of these flanges most remote from the web (edges of I-beams, center portions of 
            flanges of box or hat beams) tend to deflect toward the neutral axis. An approximate, analytical 
            treatment of this problem was given by Winter (1948b). Equation L3-1 of the Specification 
            permits one to compute the maximum permissible flange width, w f , for a given amount of flange 
            curling, c f . The equation has been shown to be conservative when compared with more recent 
            experimental data and more exact analytical expressions for predicting flange curling are now 
            available (Lecce and Rasmussen 2008, 2009). 
               It should be noted that Section L3 does not stipulate the amount of curling which can be 
            regarded as tolerable, but an amount of curling in the order of 5 percent of the depth of the 
            section is not excessive under usual conditions. In general, flange curling is not a critical factor to 
            govern the flange width. However, when the appearance of the section is important, the out-of-
            plane distortion should be closely controlled in practice. An example in the AISI Cold-Formed 
            Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013) illustrates the design consideration for flange curling.

            M.   DESIGN FOR FATIGUE 
               Fatigue in a cold-formed steel member or connection is the process of initiation and 
            subsequent growth of a crack under the action of a cyclic or repetitive load. The fatigue process 
            commonly occurs at a stress level less than the static failure condition. 
               When fatigue is a design consideration, its severity is determined primarily by three factors: 
            (1) the number of cycles of loading, (2) the type of member and connection detail, and (3) the 
            stress range at the detail under consideration (Fisher et al., 1998).   
               Fluctuation in stress, which does not involve tensile stress, does not cause crack propagation 
            and is not considered to be a fatigue situation. 
               When fabrication details involving more than one category occur at the same location in a 
            member, the design stress range at the location must be limited to that of the most restrictive 
            category. By locating notch-producing fabrication details in regions subject to a small range of 
            stress, the need for a member larger than required by static loading will often be eliminated. 
               For axially stressed angle members, the Specification allows the effects of eccentricity on the 
            weld group to be ignored provided the weld lengths L 1  and L 2  are proportional such that the 
            centroid of the weld group falls between “ x ” and “b/2” in Figure C-M-1(a). When the weld 
            lengths L 1  and L 2  are so proportioned, the effects of eccentric loads causing moment about x-x in 
            Figure C-M-1(b) also need not be considered. 




























                                                             
                                    Figure C-M-1 Welded Angle Members 
               Research by Barsom et al. (1980) and Klippstein (1980, 1981, 1985, 1988) developed fatigue 
            information on the behavior of sheet and plate steel weldments and mechanical connections. 
            Although research indicates that the values of F y  and F u  do not influence fatigue behavior, the 
            Specification provisions are based on tests using ASTM A715 (Grade 80), ASTM A607 Grade 60, 
            and SAE 1008 (F y  = 30 ksi). Using regression analysis, mean fatigue life curves (S-N curves) with

            the corresponding standard deviation were developed. The fatigue resistance S-N curve has 
            been expressed as an exponential relationship between stress range and life cycle (Fisher et al, 
            1970). The general relationship is often plotted as a linear log-log function, Equation C-M-1. 
             
              log N = C f  - m log F SR                                                     (C-M-1)

                where   
                N   = number of full stress cycles

                    = 0.25 (Klippstein, 1988) 
               The database for these design provisions is based upon cyclic testing of real joints; therefore, 
            stress concentrations have been accounted for by the categories in Table M1-1 of the Specification. 
            It is not intended that the allowable stress ranges should be compared to “hot-spot” stresses 
            determined by finite element analysis. Also, calculated stresses computed by ordinary analysis 
            need not be amplified by stress concentration factors at geometrical discontinuities and changes 
            of cross-section. All categories were found to have a common slope with m = -3. Equation M3-1 
            of the Specification is to be used to calculate the design stress range for the chosen design life, N. 
            Table M1 of the Specification provides a classification system for the various stress categories. 
            This also provides the constant, C f , that is applicable to the stress category that is required for 
            calculating design stress range, F SR .

            APPENDIX 1, EFFECTIVE WIDTH OF ELEMENTS 
               In cold-formed steel construction, individual elements of steel structural members are thin 
            and the width-to-thickness ratios are large as compared to hot-rolled steel shapes. These thin 
            elements may buckle locally at a stress level lower than the yield stress of steel when they are 
            subjected to compression in flexural bending, axial compression, shear, or bearing. Figure C-1-1 
            illustrates some local buckling patterns of certain beams and columns (Yu and LaBoube, 2010). 
               Because local buckling of individual elements of cold-formed steel sections is a major design 
            criterion, the design of such members should provide sufficient safety against the failure by 
            local instability with due consideration given to the post-buckling strength of structural 
            components. Section B4.1 and Appendix 1 of the Specification contain the design requirements for 
            width-to-thickness ratios and the design equations for determining the effective widths of

               It is well known that the structural behavior and the load-carrying capacity of a stiffened 
            compression element such as the compression flange of a hat section depend on the w/t ratio 
            and the supporting condition along both longitudinal edges. If the w/t ratio is small, the stress 
            in the compression flange can reach the yield stress of steel and the strength of the compression 
            element is governed by yielding. For the compression flange with large w/t ratios, local buckling 
            (Figure C-1-2) will occur at the following elastic critical buckling stress:

               When the elastic critical buckling stress computed according to Equation C-1-1 exceeds the 
            proportional limit of the steel, the compression element will buckle in the inelastic range (Yu 
            and LaBoube, 2010).

               Unlike one-dimensional structural members such as columns, stiffened compression 
            elements will not collapse when the buckling stress is reached. An additional load can be carried 
            by the element after buckling by means of a redistribution of stress. This phenomenon is known 
            as post-buckling strength of the compression elements and is most pronounced for stiffened 
            compression elements with large w/t ratios. The mechanism of the post-buckling action of 
            compression elements was discussed by Winter in previous editions of the Commentary (Winter, 
            1970). 
               Imagine for simplicity a square plate uniformly compressed in one direction, with the 
            unloaded edges simply supported. Since it is difficult to visualize the performance of such two-
            dimensional elements, the plate will be replaced by a model which is shown in Figure C-1-3. It 
            consists of a grid of longitudinal and transverse bars in which the material of the actual plate is 
            thought to be concentrated. Since the plate is uniformly compressed, each of the longitudinal 
            struts represents a column loaded by P/5, if P is the total load on the plate. As the load is 
            gradually increased, the compression stress in each of these struts will reach the critical column 
            buckling value and all five struts will tend to buckle simultaneously. If these struts were simple 
            columns, unsupported except at the ends, they would simultaneously collapse through 
            unrestrained increasing lateral deflection. It is evident that this cannot occur in the grid model 
            of the plate. Indeed, as soon as the longitudinal struts start deflecting at their buckling stresses, 
            the transverse bars, which are connected to them, must stretch like ties in order to accommodate 
            the imposed deflection. Like any structural material, they resist stretch and, thereby, have a 
            restraining effect on the deflections of the longitudinal struts.

               The tension forces in the horizontal bars of the grid model correspond to the so-called 
            membrane stresses in a real plate. These stresses, just as in the grid model, come into play as soon 
            as the compression stresses begin to cause buckling waves. They consist mostly of transverse 
            tension, but also of some shear stresses, and they counteract increasing wave deflections, i.e., 
            they tend to stabilize the plate against further buckling under the applied increasing longitudinal 
            compression. Hence, the resulting behavior of the model is as follows: (a) there is no collapse by 
            unrestrained deflections, as in unsupported columns, and (b) the various struts will deflect 
            unequal amounts—those nearest the supported edges being held almost straight by the ties, 
            and those nearest the center being able to deflect most. 
               In consequence of (a), the model will not collapse and fail when its buckling stress (Equation 
            C-1-1) is reached; in contrast to columns, it will merely develop slight deflections but will 
            continue to carry increasing load. In consequence of (b), the struts (strips of the plate) closest to 
            the center, which deflect most, “get away from the load,” and hardly participate in carrying any 
            further load increases. These center strips may, in fact, even transfer part of their pre-buckling 
            load to their neighbors. The struts (or strips) closest to the edges, held straight by the ties,

            continue to resist increasing load with hardly any increasing deflection. For the plate, this means 
            that the hitherto uniformly distributed compression stress redistributes itself in a manner shown 
            in Figure C-1-4, with the stresses being largest at the edges and smallest in the center. With 
            further increase in load, this nonuniformity increases, as also shown in Figure C-1-4. The plate 
            fails, i.e., refuses to carry any further load increases, only when the most highly stressed strips 
            near the supported edges begin to yield, i.e., when the compression stress f max  reaches the yield 
            stress F y . 




























                                                               
                           Figure C-1-3 Post-Buckling Strength [Resistance] Model 

               This post-buckling strength of plates was discovered experimentally in 1928, and an 
            approximate theory of it was first given by Th. v. Karman in 1932 (Bleich, 1952). It has been 
            used in aircraft design ever since. A graphic illustration of the phenomenon of post-buckling 
            strength can be found in the series of photographs in Figure 7 of Winter (1959b). 
               The model of Figure C-1-3 is representative of the behavior of a compression element 
            supported along both longitudinal edges, as the flange in Figure C-1-2. In fact, such elements 
            buckle into approximately square waves.  
               In order to utilize the post-buckling strength of the stiffened compression element for design 
            purposes, the Specification has used the effective design width approach to determine the sectional 
            properties since 1946. In Appendix 1 of the Specification, design equations for computing the 
            effective widths are provided for the following cases: (1) uniformly compressed stiffened 
            elements, (2) uniformly compressed stiffened elements with circular or noncircular holes, (3) 
            webs and other stiffened elements with stress gradient, (4) unstiffened elements with uniform or 
            gradient stress, and (5) C-section webs with holes under stress gradient. The background 
            information on various design requirements is discussed in subsequent sections.

            1.1 Effective Width of Uniformly Compressed Stiffened Elements 

            (a) Strength Determination 
               In the effective design width approach, instead of considering the nonuniform distribution 
               of stress over the entire width of the plate w, it is assumed that the total load is carried by a 
               fictitious effective width b, subject to a uniformly distributed stress equal to the edge stress 
               fmax , as shown in Figure C-1-4. The width b is selected so that the area under the curve of 
               the actual nonuniform stress distribution is equal to the sum of the two parts of the 
               equivalent rectangular shaded area with a total width b and an intensity of stress equal to 
               the edge stress f max . 
               Based on the concept of effective width introduced by von Karman et al. (von Karman, 
               Sechler and Donnell, 1932) and the extensive investigation on light-gage, cold-formed steel 
               sections at Cornell University, the following equation was developed by Winter in 1946 for 
               determining the effective width b for stiffened compression elements simply supported along 
               both longitudinal edges: 
                         E       t  E        t9.1b=             475.01−                                                 (C-1.1-1)  fmax       w fmax 
                The above equation can be written in terms of the ratio of F cr /f max  as follows: 

                 b    F                 =   cr          F    25.01 −      cr                                             (C-1.1-2)  w   f              max        fmax 
               where F cr  is the critical elastic buckling stress of a plate, and is expressed in Equation  
               C-1-1. 
               Thus, the effective width expression (e.g., Equation C-1.1-1) provides a prediction of the 
               nominal strength [resistance] based only on the critical elastic buckling stress and the applied 
               stress of the plate. During the period from 1946 to 1968, the Specification design provision for 
               the determination of the effective design width was based on Equation C-1.1-1. Accumulated 
               experience has demonstrated that a more realistic equation as shown below may be used for 
               the determination of the effective width b (Winter, 1970): 
                         E t9.1b =             415.01 −    t   E                                                                 (C-1.1-3)  fmax       w fmax 

               The correlation between the test data on stiffened compression elements and Equation  
               C-1.1-3 is illustrated by Yu and LaBoube (2010). 
               It should be noted that Equation C-1.1-3 may also be rewritten in terms of the F cr /f max  
               ratio as follows: 
                 b    F                 =   cr          F    22.01−      cr                                             (C-1.1-4)  w   f              max        fmax 
               Therefore, the effective width, b, can be determined as 
                 b = ρw                                                            (C-1.1-5) 
                  where ρ = reduction factor

                  In Equation C-1.1-6, λ is a slenderness factor determined below. 
                    λ =        F/f     crmax                                                     (C-1.1-7) 
               Figure C-1.1-1 shows the relationship between ρ and λ. It can be seen that when λ ≤ 0.673, 
               ρ = 1.0.

               Based on Equations C-1.1-5 through C-1.1-7 and the unified approach proposed by Peköz 
               (1986b and 1986c), the 1986 edition of the Specification adopted the non-dimensional format 
               in Section 1.1 for determining the effective design width, b, for uniformly compressed stiffened 
               elements. The same design equations were used in the 1996 edition of the Specification and 
               were retained in this edition of the Specification. For design examples, see Part I of the AISI 
               Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013). 
            (b) Serviceability Determination 
               The effective design width equations discussed above for strength determination can also 
               be used to obtain a conservative effective width, b d , for serviceability determination. It is 
               included in Section 1.1(b) of the Specification as Procedure I. 
               For stiffened compression elements supported by a web on each longitudinal edge, a 
               study conducted by Weng and Peköz (1986) indicated that Equations 1.1-6 through 1.1-8 of

               the Specification can yield a more accurate estimate of the effective width, b d , for serviceability. 
               These equations are given in Procedure II for additional design information. The design 
               engineer has the option of using either of the two procedures for determining the effective 
               width to be used for serviceability determination. 
             
              1.1.1 Uniformly Compressed Stiffened Elements With Circular or Noncircular Holes 

                 In cold-formed steel structural members, holes are sometimes provided in webs and/or flanges 
              of beams and columns for duct work, piping, and other construction purposes. The presence 
              of such holes may result in a reduction of the strength of individual component elements and 
              the overall strength and stiffness of the members depending on the size, shape, and 
              arrangement of holes, the geometric configuration of the cross-section, and the mechanical 
              properties of the material. 
                 The exact analysis and the design of steel sections having perforations are complex, 
              particularly when the shapes and the arrangement of holes are unusual. The limited design 
              provisions included in Section 1.1.1 of the Specification for uniformly compressed stiffened 
              elements with circular holes are based on a study conducted by Ortiz-Colberg and Peköz at 
              Cornell University (Ortiz-Colberg and Peköz, 1981). For additional information on the 
              structural behavior of perforated elements, see Yu and Davis (1973a) and Yu and LaBoube 
              (2010). 
                 In 2004, Specification Equation 1.1.1-2 was revised to provide continuity at λ = 0.673. 
                 Within the limitations stated for the size and spacing of perforations and section depth, 
              the provisions were deemed appropriate for members with uniformly compressed stiffened 
              elements, not just wall studs. The validity of this approach for C-section wall studs was 
              verified in a Cornell University project on wall studs reported by Miller and Peköz (1989 and 
              1994). The limitations included in Specification Section 1.1.1 for the size and spacing of 
              perforations and the depth of studs are based on the parameters used in the test program. 
              Although Figure 1.1.1-1 in the Specification shows a hole centered within the flat width, w, 
              holes not centered within w are allowed. For such a case, the unstiffened strip, c, and 
              resulting effective width, b, must be calculated separately for the strips on each side of the hole. 
              For sections with perforations which do not meet these limits, the effective area, A e , can be 
              determined by stub column tests.  
                 The geometric limitations (w/t, etc.) and hole size for the circular and noncircular hole 
              provisions in Specification Section 1.1.1 are not consistent with one another. This anomaly in 
              the limitations is due to the differing scopes of the test programs that serve as the basis for 
              these effective width equations. The provisions for noncircular holes generally give a more 
              conservative prediction of the effective width than the provisions for circular holes, as long as 
              dh /w < 0.4. Provisions for designing perforated members using the Direct Strength Method 
              (DSM) can be found in Specification Sections E and F, and Appendix 2. 
             
              1.1.2 Webs and Other Stiffened Elements Under Stress Gradient 

                 When a beam is subjected to bending moment, the compression portion of the web may 
              buckle due to the compressive stress caused by bending. The theoretical critical buckling stress 
              for a flat rectangular plate under pure bending can be determined by Equation C-1-1, except 
              that the depth-to-thickness ratio, h/t, is substituted for the width-to-thickness ratio, w/t, and 
              the plate buckling coefficient, k, is equal to 23.9 for simple supports as listed in Table C-1-1.

                 Prior to 1986, the design of cold-formed steel beam webs was based on the full web depth 
              with the allowable bending stress specified in the Specification. In order to unify the design 
              methods for web elements and compression flanges, the effective design depth approach was 
              adopted in the 1986 edition of the Specification on the basis of the studies made by Peköz 
              (1986b), Cohen and Peköz (1987). This is a different approach as compared with the past 
              practice of using a full area of the web element in conjunction with a reduced stress to account 
              for local buckling and post-buckling strength (LaBoube and Yu, 1982b; Yu, 1985). 
                 Prior to 2001, the b 1  and b 2  expressions used in the Specification for the effective width of 
              webs (Equations 1.1.2-3 through 1.1.2-5) implicitly assumed that the flange provided beneficial 
              restraint to the web. Collected data (Cohen and Peköz (1987), Elhouar and Murray (1985), 
              Ellifritt et al. (1997), Hancock et al (1996), LaBoube and Yu (1978), Moreyra and Peköz (1993), 
              Rogers and Schuster (1995), Schardt and Schrade (1982), Schuster (1992), Shan et al. (1994), 
              and Willis and Wallace (1990) as summarized in Schafer and Peköz (1999)) on flexural tests of 
              C- and Z-sections indicate that Specification Equations 1.1.2-3 through 1.1.2-5 can be 
              unconservative if the overall web width (h o ) to overall flange width (b o ) ratio exceeds 4. 
              Consequently, in 2001, in the absence of a comprehensive method for handling local web and 
              flange interaction, the Specification adopted a two-part approach for the effective width of webs: 
              an additional set of alternative expressions (Equations 1.1.2-6 and 1.1.2-7), originally 
              developed by Cohen and Peköz (1987), were adopted for h o /b o  > 4; while the expressions 
              adopted in the 1986 edition of the Specification (Equations 1.1.2-3 through 1.1.2-5) remain for 
              ho /b o  ≤ 4. For flexural members with local buckling in the web, the effect of these changes is 
              that the strengths will be somewhat lower when h o /b o  > 4 compared with the 1996 
              Specification (AISI, 1996). When compared with the CSA S136 (CSA, 1994) Standard, there are 
              only minor changes for members with h o /b o  > 4, but an increase in strength will be 
              experienced when h o /b o  ≤ 4. 
                 It should be noted that in the Specification, the stress ratio, ψ, is defined as an absolute 
              value. As a result, some signs for ψ have been changed in Specification Equations 1.1.2-2, 1.1.2-
              3, 1.1.2-6 and 1.1.2-7 as compared with the 1996 edition of the Specification (AISI, 1996). 
             
              1.1.3 C-Section Webs With Holes Under Stress Gradient 

                 Studies of the behavior of web elements with holes conducted at the University of 
              Missouri-Rolla (UMR) serve as the basis for the design recommendations for bending alone, 
              shear, web crippling, combinations of bending and shear, and bending and web crippling (Shan 
              et al., 1994; Langan et al., 1994; Uphoff, 1996; Deshmukh, 1996). The Specification considers a 
              hole to be any flat-punched opening in the web without any edge-stiffened openings. 
                 The UMR design recommendations for a perforated web with stress gradient are based on 
              the tests of full-scale C-section beams having h/t ratios as large as 200 and d h /h ratios as 
              large as 0.74. The test program considered only stud and joist industry standard web holes. 
              These holes were rectangular with fillet corners, punched during the rolling process. For 
              noncircular holes, the corner radii recommendation was adopted to avoid the potential of 
              high stress concentration at the corners of a hole. Webs with circular holes and a stress gradient 
              were not tested; however, the provisions are conservatively extended to cover this case. 
              Other shaped holes must be evaluated by the virtual hole method described below, by test, or 
              by other provisions of the Specification. The Specification is not intended to cover cross-sections 
              having repetitive 1/2-in. diameter holes.

                 Based on the study by Shan et al. (1994), it was determined that the nominal bending 
              strength [resistance] of a C-section with a web hole is unaffected when d h /h < 0.38. For 
              situations where the d h /h ≥ 0.38, the effective depth of the web can be determined by treating 
              the flat portion of the remaining web that is in compression as an unstiffened compression 
              element. 
                 Although these provisions are based on tests of singly-symmetric C-sections having the 
              web hole centered at mid-depth of the section, the provisions may be conservatively applied 
              to sections for which the full unreduced compression region of the web is less than the tension 
              region. However, for cross-sections having a compression region greater than the tension 
              region, the web strength must be determined by test in accordance with Section K2.1. 
                 The provisions for circular and noncircular holes also apply to any hole pattern that fits 
              within an equivalent virtual hole. For example, Figure C-1.1.3-1 illustrates the L h  and d h  that 
              may be used for a multiple-hole pattern that fits within a noncircular virtual hole. Figure C-
              1.1.3-2 illustrates the d h  that may be used for a rectangular hole that exceeds the 2.5 in. (64 
              mm) by 4.5 in. (114 mm) limit but still fits within an allowed circular virtual hole. For each 
              case, the design provisions apply to the geometry of the virtual hole, not the actual hole or 
              holes.

              1.1.4 Uniformly Compressed Elements Restrained by Intermittent Connections 

                 Section I1.3 limits the spacing of connections in compression elements so that the strength 
              of the section is fully developed before buckling occurs between connections. In practice this 
              limitation is often exceeded. Luttrell and Balaji (1992) and Snow and Easterling (2008) 
              developed a method to determine the effective width of compression elements when greater 
              connection spacing exists. The design provisions in Specification Section 1.1.4 were based on

              specimens had multiple flutes and the depth range was between 1-½ in. (38.1 mm) and 7-½ 
              in. (191 mm). As shown in Figures C-1.1.4-1 and C-1.1.4-2, all test compression plates had 
              edge stiffeners.

                                  Figure C-1.1.4-2 Built-Up Deck in Bending 


                 The full stress potential of the “built-up” section is determined by recognizing the post-
              buckling strength of the compression plate after local waves form between connections. The 
              method models an equivalent composite transformed section and maintains the classical 
              assumption of linear strain distribution. The critical compression stress, F c , is based on 
              “column-like” buckling in the plate. The connections provide fixed-end column restraint and 
              K = 0.5. Before such buckling occurs (f < F c ), the effective width of the section is calculated using 
              Section 1.1 with the connection lines treated as webs. When the critical stress is reached and 
              exceeded (f ≥ F c ), the compression plate might not resist the same stress, f c , as the adjacent 
              element that theoretically has slightly less strain. An equivalent width is determined to 
              provide the approximate true force contribution of the buckled plate in resisting bending. 
              This equivalent width is assumed to have an artificially high stress, f, which is compatible 
              with both a constant “E” and linear strain distribution across the “built-up” section; however, 
              the actual stress might be between F c  and f. ρt  provides the effective width at F c , and   ρm  allows 
              further effective width reduction to   provide the   equivalent force. The equivalent transformed 
              section properties cannot be greater than the section calculated using Specification Section 1.1 
              at the stress level, f. The moment of inertia for deflection is determined by substituting the 
              maximum stress at service load for F y  and the compression stress at service load, f d , for f in 
              Specification Section 1.1.4.  
                 Figure C-1.1.4-2 shows the built-up deck section in bending. In Figures C-1.1.4-1 and C-

              1.1.4-2, s is the center-to-center connection spacing along the plate, w is the center-to-center 
              connection spacing across the plate, t is the thickness of cover plate, t 2  is the thickness of the 
              member connected to the cover plate, f is the compression stress in the cover plate, f c  is the 
              compression stress in the element connected to the cover plate, f t  is the maximum tension 
              stress in the member connected to the cover plate, and d is the overall depth of the built-up 
              member. 
                 In 2012, provisions for determining the effective width between the first line of fasteners 
              and the edge stiffener and the effective length of the stiffener were added. The post-buckling 
              stress at the first interior line of connections is applied across the first interior width, w 1  or w 3 , 
              as illustrated in Figure C-1.1.4-1, and at the edge stiffener. Specification Equation 1.1.4-7 is 
              based on the approximate shape of the half sine wave restrained by the connectors in the 
              compression element and by the edge stiffener. w’ given in Specification Equation 1.1.4-7 is 
              twice the distance from the stiffener to the apex of the wave and models w in Specification 
              Section 1.3 for the same wave length. Equation 1.1.4-6 sets w as e before “column-like” 
              buckling occurs. Specification Equations 1.3-7 to 1.3-10 are then applied based on w and f. 
              When f reaches or exceeds F c , Specification Equations 1.3-7 to 1.3-10 are applied based on w’ 
              and f’ to evaluate the stiffener. ρm f approximates the post-buckling stress that cannot be less 
              than F c  since the stiffener must resist F c  as buckling begins.  
                 Jones (Jones et al., 1997) validated Luttrell’s method (1992), but the researchers cautioned 
              its use for single-fluted members having compression plates with edge stiffeners. Luttrell and 
              Balaji (1992) tested built-up deck with compression plate thickness between 0.045 in. (1.14 
              mm) and 0.06 in. (1.52 mm). Jones (1997) investigated unstiffened cover plates to 0.017 in. 
              (0.432 mm) in thickness. The research work at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) 
              indicated that the method worked reasonably well for single-fluted members having 
              unstiffened compression plates when the plate thickness exceeded 0.045 in. (1.14 mm). See the 
              illustrative example in the AISI Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013). 
             
            1.2 Effective Widths of Unstiffened Elements 

               Similar to stiffened compression elements, the stress in the unstiffened compression elements 
            can reach to the yield stress of steel if the w/t ratio is small. Because the unstiffened element has 
            one longitudinal edge supported by the web and the other edge is free, the limiting width-to-
            thickness ratio of unstiffened elements is much less than that for stiffened elements. 
               When the w/t ratio of the unstiffened element is large, local buckling (Figure C-1.2-1) will 
            occur at the elastic critical stress determined by Equation C-1-1 with a value of k = 0.43. This 
            buckling coefficient is listed in Table C-1-1 for case (c). For the intermediate range of w/t ratios, 
            the unstiffened element will buckle in the inelastic range. Figure C-1.2-2 shows the relationship 
            between the maximum stress for unstiffened compression elements and the w/t ratio, in which Line 
            A is the yield stress of steel, Line B represents the inelastic buckling stress, and Curves C and D 
            illustrate the elastic buckling stress. The equations for Curves A, B, C, and D have been 
            developed from previous experimental and analytical investigations and used for determining 
            the allowable stresses in the Specification up to 1986 (Winter, 1970; Yu and LaBoube, 2010). Also 
            shown in Figure C-1.2-2 is Curve E, which represents the maximum stress on the basis of the 
            post-buckling strength of the unstiffened element. The correlation between some test data on 
            unstiffened elements and the predicted maximum stresses is shown in Figure C-1.2-3 (Yu and 
            LaBoube, 2010).

               Prior to 1986, it had been a general practice to design cold-formed steel members with 
            unstiffened flanges by using the Allowable Stress Design approach. The effective width equation 
            was not used in earlier editions of the Specification due to lack of extensive experimental 
            verification and the concern for excessive out-of-plane distortions under service loads. 
               In the 1970s, the applicability of the effective width concept to unstiffened elements under 
            uniform compression was studied in detail by Kalyanaraman, Peköz, and Winter at Cornell 
            University (Kalyanaraman, Peköz, and Winter, 1977; Kalyanaraman and Peköz, 1978). The 
            evaluation of the test data using k = 0.43 was presented and summarized by Peköz in the AISI 
            report (Peköz, 1986b), which indicates that Equation C-1.1-6 developed for stiffened 
            compression elements gives a conservative lower bound to the test results of unstiffened 
            compression elements. In addition to the strength determination, the same study also investigated 
            the out-of-plane deformations in unstiffened elements. The results of theoretical calculations 
            and the test results on the sections having unstiffened elements with w/t = 60 were presented 
            by Peköz in the same report. It was found that the maximum amplitude of the out-of-plane

            deformation at failure can be twice the thickness as the w/t ratio approaches 60. However, the 
            deformations are significantly less under the service loads. Based on the above reasons and 
            justifications, the effective design width approach was adopted for the first time in the 1986 
            Specification for the design of cold-formed steel members having unstiffened compression elements. 
             
              1.2.1 Uniformly Compressed Unstiffened Elements 

                 In the Specification, it is specified that the effective widths, b, of uniformly compressed 
              unstiffened elements can be determined in accordance with Section 1.1(a) of the Specification 
              with the exception that the buckling coefficient, k, is taken as 0.43. This is a theoretical value 
              for long plates. See case (c) in Table C-1-1. For serviceability determination, the effective widths 
              of uniformly compressed unstiffened elements can only be determined according to 
              Procedure I of Section 1.1(b) of the Specification, because Procedure II was developed only for 
              stiffened compression elements. See Part I of the AISI Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual for 
              design examples (AISI, 2013). 
             
              1.2.2 Unstiffened Elements and Edge Stiffeners With Stress Gradient 

                 In concentrically loaded compression members and in flexural members where the 
              unstiffened compression element is parallel to the neutral axis, the stress distribution is 
              uniform prior to local buckling. However, when edge stiffeners of the compression element are 
              present, the compressive stress in the edge stiffener is not uniform but varies in proportion to 
              the distance from the neutral axis in flexural members. The unstiffened element (the edge 
              stiffener) in this case has compressive stress applied at both longitudinal edges. The 
              unstiffened element of a section may also be subjected to stress gradients causing tension at 
              one longitudinal edge and compression at the other longitudinal edge. This can occur in I-
              sections, plain channel sections and angle sections in minor axis bending.

                 Prior to the 2001 edition of the Specification, unstiffened elements with stress gradient were 
              designed using the Winter effective width equation (Equation C-1.1-4) and k = 0.43. In 2004, 
              Section 1.2.2 of the Specification adopted the effective width method for unstiffened elements 
              with stress gradient proposed by Bambach and Rasmussen (2002a, 2002b and 2002c), based on 
              an extensive experimental investigation of unstiffened plates tested as isolated elements in 
              combined compression and bending. The effective width, b, (measured from the supported 
              edge) of unstiffened elements with stress gradient causing compression at both longitudinal 
              edges, is calculated using the Winter equation. For unstiffened elements with stress gradients 
              causing tension at one longitudinal edge and compression at the other longitudinal edge, 
              modified Winter equations are specified when tension exists at either the supported or the 
              unsupported edges. The effective width equations apply to any unstiffened element under 
              stress gradient,  and are not restricted to particular cross-sections. Figure C-1.2.2-1 
              demonstrates how the effective width of an unstiffened element increases as the stress at the 
              supported edge changes from compression to tension. As shown in the figure, the effective 
              width curve is independent of the stress ratio, ψ, when both edges are in compression. In this 
              case, the effect of stress ratio is accounted for by the plate buckling coefficient, k, which varies 
              with stress ratio and affects the slenderness, λ. When the supported edge is in tension and the 
              unsupported edge is in compression, both the effective width curve and the plate buckling 
              coefficient depend on the stress ratio, as per Equations 1.2.2-4 and 1.2.2-5 of the Specification.  
                 Equations are provided for k, determined from the stress ratio, ψ, applied to the full 
              element width, and k will usually be higher than 0.43. The equations for k are theoretical 
              solutions for long plates assuming simple support along the longitudinal edge. A more 
              accurate determination of k by accounting for interaction between adjoining elements is 
              permitted for plain channels in minor axis bending (causing compression at the unsupported 
              edge of the unstiffened element), based on research of plain channels in compression and 
              bending by Yiu and Peköz (2001).  
                 In the 2016 edition of the Specification, the definition of the stresses f 1  and f 2  was revised to

              reflect that the effective width calculations for unstiffened elements should be determined 
              iteratively due to a shift of the neutral axis location, as with other elements in the cross-
              section. However, if all other elements are fully effective, the stresses f 1  and f 2  may be based 
              on the gross cross-section such that iteration is not required. 
                 The effective width is located adjacent to the supported edge for all stress ratios, including 
              those producing tension at the unsupported edge. Research has found (Bambach and 
              Rasmussen, 2002a) that for the unsupported edge to be effective, tension must be applied 
              over at least half of the width of the element starting at the unsupported edge. For less 
              tension, the unsupported edge will buckle and the effective part of the element is located 
              adjacent to the supported edge. Further, when tension is applied over half of the element or 
              more starting at the unsupported edge, the compressed part of the element will remain 
              effective for elements with w/t ratios less than the limits set out in Section B4.1 of the 
              Specification.  
                 The method for serviceability determination is based on the method used for stiffened 
              elements with stress gradient in Section 1.1.2(b) of the Specification.  
             
            1.3 Effective Width of Uniformly Compressed Elements With a Simple Lip Edge Stiffener 

               An edge stiffener is used to provide continuous support along a longitudinal edge of the 
            compression flange to improve the buckling stress. In most cases, the edge stiffener takes the form 
            of a simple lip. Other types of edge stiffeners can be beneficial and are also used for cold-
            formed steel members, but are not covered in Specification Section 1.3. 
               In order to provide necessary support for the compression element, the edge stiffener must 
            possess sufficient rigidity. Otherwise, it may buckle perpendicular to the plane of the element to 
            be stiffened. As far as the design provisions are concerned, the 1980 and earlier editions of the 
            AISI Specification included the requirements for the minimum moment of inertia of stiffeners to 
            provide sufficient rigidity. When the size of the actual stiffener does not satisfy the required 
            moment of inertia, the load-carrying capacity of the beam has to be determined either on the 
            basis of a flat element disregarding the stiffener or through tests. 
               Both theoretical and experimental studies on the local stability of compression flanges 
            stiffened by edge stiffeners have been carried out in the past. The design requirements included 
            in the 1986 Specification were based on the investigations of adequately stiffened and partially 
            stiffened elements conducted by Desmond, Peköz and Winter (1981a), with additional research 
            work by Peköz and Cohen (Peköz, 1986b). These design provisions were developed on the basis 
            of the critical buckling criterion and the post-buckling strength criterion. 
               Specification Section 1.3 recognizes that the necessary stiffener rigidity depends upon the 
            slenderness (w/t) of the plate element being stiffened. The interaction of the plate elements, as 
            well as the degree of edge support, full or partial, is compensated for in the expressions for k, 
            ds , and A s  (Peköz, 1986b). 
               In the 1996 edition of the Specification (AISI, 1996), the design equations for buckling 
            coefficient were changed for further clarity. The requirement of 140° ≥ θ ≥ 40° for the 
            applicability of these provisions was decided on an intuitive basis. For design examples, see 
            Part I of the AISI Cold-Formed Steel Manual (AISI, 2013). 
               Test data to verify the accuracy of the simple lip stiffener design was collected from a 
            number of sources, both university and industry. These tests showed good correlation with the 
            equations in Specification Section 1.3.

               In 2001, Dinovitzer’s expressions (Dinovitzer, et al., 1992) for n (Specification Equation 1.3-11) 
            were adopted, which eliminated a discontinuity that existed in the previous design expressions. 
            The revised equation gives n =1/2 for w/t = 0.328S and n = 1/3 for w/t = S, in which S is also 
            the maximum w/t ratio for a stiffened element to be fully effective. 
               In 2007, the expressions were limited to cover only simple lip edge stiffeners, as the 
            previously employed expressions for complex lip stiffeners were found to be unconservative in 
            comparison with rigorous nonlinear finite element analysis (Schafer, et al., 2006). Design of 
            members with complex lips may be handled via the Direct Strength Method provided in 
            Chapters E and F, as applicable. In addition, the design provisions for the uniformly 
            compressed elements with one intermediate stiffener were deleted in the 2007 edition of the 
            Specification due to the fact that the effective width of such members can be determined in 
            accordance with Specification Section 1.4.1. 
             
            1.4 Effective Widths of Stiffened Elements With Single or Multiple Intermediate Stiffeners or 
               Edge-Stiffened Elements With Intermediate Stiffener(s) 

              1.4.1 Effective Width of Uniformly Compressed Stiffened Elements With Single or Multiple 
                   Intermediate Stiffeners 

                 The structural efficiency of a stiffened element always exceeds that of an unstiffened 
              element with the same w/t ratio by a sizeable margin, except for low w/t ratios, for which 
              the compression element is fully effective. When stiffened elements with large w/t ratios are 
              used, the material is not employed economically inasmuch as an increasing proportion of the 
              width of the compression element becomes ineffective. On the other hand, in many 
              applications of cold-formed steel construction, such as panels and decks, maximum coverage 
              is desired and, therefore, large w/t ratios are called for. In such cases, structural economy can 
              be improved by providing intermediate stiffeners between webs. 
                 The buckling behavior of rectangular plates with central stiffeners is discussed by Bulson 
              (1969). For the design of cold-formed steel beams using intermediate stiffeners, the 1980 
              Specification contained provisions for the minimum required moment of inertia, which was 
              based on the assumption that an intermediate stiffener needed to be twice as rigid as an edge 
              stiffener. In view of the fact that for some cases the design requirements for intermediate 
              stiffeners included in the 1980 Specification could be unduly conservative (Peköz, 1986b), the 
              design provisions were revised in 1986 according to Peköz’s research findings (Peköz, 1986b 
              and 1986c). In 2007, the design of uniformly compressed elements with multiple or single 
              intermediate stiffeners was merged. The multiple intermediate stiffener provisions were 
              developed based on Peköz’s continuing research on intermediate stiffeners (Schafer and 
              Peköz, 1998) and the finding that the method developed in Section 1.4.1 of the Specification for 
              multiple intermediate stiffeners could provide the same reliability as the method for single 
              intermediate stiffeners (Yang and Schafer, 2006) in the previous edition of the Specification 
              (AISI, 2001).  
                 Prior to 2001, the AISI Specification and the Canadian Standard provided different design 
              provisions for determination of the effective widths of uniformly compressed stiffened 
              elements with multiple intermediate stiffeners or edge-stiffened elements with intermediate 
              stiffeners. In the Specification, the design requirements of Section 1.4 dealt with: (1) the 
              minimum moment of inertia of the intermediate stiffener, (2) the number of intermediate 
              stiffeners considered to be effective, (3) the “equivalent element” of multiple-stiffened element 
              having closely spaced intermediate stiffeners, (4) the effective width of sub-element with w/t >

              60, and (5) the reduced area of stiffeners. In the Canadian Standard, a different design 
              equation was used to determine the equivalent thickness. 
                 In 2001, Specification Section 1.4.1 was revised to reflect recent research findings for 
              flexural members with multiple intermediate stiffeners in the compression flange (Papazian et 
              al., 1994; Schafer and Peköz, 1998; Acharya and Schuster, 1998). The method is based on 
              determining the plate buckling coefficient for the two competing modes of buckling: local 
              buckling, in which the stiffener does not move; and distortional buckling, in which the stiffener 
              buckles with the entire plate. See Figure C-1.4.1-1. Experimental research shows that the 
              distortional mode is prevalent for members with multiple intermediate stiffeners.

                             Compressed Element With Multiple Intermediate Stiffeners 
                       The reduction factor, ρ, is applied to the entire element (gross area  of the 
              element/thickness) instead of only the flat portions. Reducing the entire element to an effective 
              width, which ignores the geometry of the stiffeners, for effective section property calculation 
              allows distortional buckling to be treated consistently with the rest of the Specification, rather 
              than as an “effective area” or other method. The resulting effective width must act at the centroid 
              of the original element including the stiffeners. This ensures that the neutral axis location for 
              the member is unaffected by the use of the simple effective width, which replaces the more 
              complicated geometry of the element with multiple intermediate stiffeners. One possible 
              result of this approach is that the calculated effective width (b e ) may be greater than b o . This 
              may occur when ρ is near 1, and is due to the fact that b e  includes contributions from the 
              stiffener area and b o  does not. As long as the calculated b e  is placed at the centroid of the 
              entire element, the use of b e >b o  is correct. 
                 In 2010, Specification Equation 1.4.1.1-1 was replaced by 
                  kloc  = 4(b o /b p )2                                                    (C-1.4.1-1) 
                    where 
                    kloc  = Plate buckling coefficient of element 
                    bo   = Total flat width of stiffened element 
                    bp   = Sub-element flat width for flange with equally spaced stiffeners 
                 This replacement ensures that Specification Sections 1.4.1.1 and 1.4.1.2 provide the same 
              answer for sub-element local buckling, and replaces the overly conservative estimate of the 
              2007 edition of the Specification Equation 1.4.1.1-1, which ignored the stiffener width (Schafer,

              1.4.2 Edge-Stiffened Elements With Intermediate Stiffener(s) 

                 The buckling modes for edge-stiffened elements with one or more intermediate stiffeners 
              include local sub-element buckling, distortional buckling of the intermediate stiffener, and 
              distortional buckling of the edge stiffener, as shown in Figure C-1.4.2-1. If the edge-stiffened 
              element is stocky (b o /t < 0.328S) or the stiffener is large enough (I s  > I a  and thus k = 4, per the 
              rules of Specification Section 1.3), then the edge-stiffened element performs as a stiffened 
              element. In this case, effective width for local sub-element buckling and distortional buckling of 
              the intermediate stiffener may be predicted by the rules of Specification Section 1.4.1. 
              However, an edge-stiffened element does not have the same web rotational restraint as a 
              stiffened element; therefore, the constant R of Specification Section 1.4.1 is conservatively 
              limited to be less than or equal to 1.0.

                                           Intermediate Stiffeners 

                 If the edge-stiffened element is partially effective (b o /t > 0.328S and I s  < I a  and thus k < 4, 
              per the rules of Specification Section 1.3), then the intermediate stiffener(s) should be ignored 
              and the provisions of Specification Section 1.3 followed. Elastic buckling analysis of the 
              distortional mode for an edge-stiffened element with intermediate stiffener(s) indicates that 
              the effect of intermediate stiffener(s) on the distortional buckling stress is ±10 percent for 
              practical intermediate and edge stiffener sizes. 
                 When applying Specification Section 1.4.2 for effective width determination of edge-stiffened 
              elements with intermediate stiffeners, the effective width of the intermediately stiffened flange, 
              be , is replaced by an equivalent flat section (as shown in Specification Figure 1.4.1-2). The edge 
              stiffener should not be used in determining the centroid location of the equivalent flat effective 
              width, b e , for the intermediately stiffened flange. 
                 Stub compression testing performed in 2003 demonstrates the adequacy of this approach 
              (Yang and Hancock, 2003).

          APPENDIX 2, ELASTIC BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF MEMBERS 
             Elastic buckling stress, or stress resultants (axial force, shear force, bending moment, etc.) are 
          used extensively in the Specification for the determination of strength. The buckling of cold-
          formed steel members includes traditional global buckling modes such as flexural buckling and 
          lateral-torsional buckling, as well as buckling modes that include cross-sectional deformation such 
          as local buckling and distortional buckling. 
             It is important to realize that elastic buckling itself is not a limit state. Elastic buckling stress or 
          stress resultants are instead used as inputs in various strength equations throughout the 
          Specification. For example, in determining the nominal strength [resistance] of a column, Section E2 
          requires the global buckling stress, and Section E3 requires the local buckling stress either 
          implicitly in determining the effective width in Section E3.1 or explicitly after conversion to a 
          local buckling force in the Direct Strength Method of Section E3.2. Section E4 requires the input of 
          distortional buckling force. In each case, the elastic buckling stress (or its resultant) is employed in 
          strength expressions that provide varying degrees of post-buckling reserve and interaction with 
          yielding and other buckling modes in determining the nominal strength [resistance] in a given limit 
          state. 
           
          2.1  General Provisions  
             The Specification does not place a preference for what methods are used to determine elastic 
          buckling stress or stress resultants. Conversion between stress and stress resultants is provided. 
           
          2.2  Numerical Solutions 
            2.2.1  Elastic Buckling of Cold-Formed Steel Members 
               The fundamental buckling modes in a cold-formed steel member include: local buckling, 
            distortional buckling, and global buckling modes: flexural buckling, torsional buckling, and 
            flexural-torsional buckling for compression members, and lateral-torsional buckling for bending 
            members. The fundamental buckling modes are illustrated in Figure C-2.2.1-1.

             The elastic buckling load (force) is the load in which the equilibrium of the member is neutral 
          between two alternative states: buckled and straight. Thin-walled cold-formed steel members 
          have at least three relevant elastic buckling modes: local, distortional, and global (Figure C-2.2.2-
          2). The global buckling mode includes flexural, torsional, or flexural-torsional buckling for columns, 
          and lateral-torsional buckling for beams. 
             The Effective Width Method traditionally addressed local and global buckling. The distortional 
          buckling consideration was added in 2004. Further, the Effective Width approach to local buckling 
          is to conceptualize the member as a collection of “elements” and investigate local buckling of 
          each element separately. 
             The Direct Strength Method, introduced in 2004, provides a means to incorporate all three 
          relevant buckling modes into the design process. Further, all buckling modes are determined for 
          the member as a whole rather than element by element. This ensures that compatibility and 
          equilibrium are maintained at element junctures. 
            Local Buckling. Limit state of buckling of a compression element where the line junctions 
               between elements remain straight and angles between elements do not change. 
                   Local buckling involves significant distortion of the cross-section, but this distortion 
                involves only rotation, not translation, at the fold lines of the member, as shown in 
                Figure C-2.2.1-1. The buckling half-wavelength (L cr ) for local buckling is less than the 
                largest characteristic dimension of the member under compressive stress (this length is 
                demarcated with a short vertical dashed line in the examples of Figure C-2.2.2-2). Since 
                the local buckling half-wavelength is short, local buckling is difficult to retard, and in 
                general must always be considered. Changes to the geometry of the member (stiffeners, 
                change of thickness, etc.) are the most effective means for changing local buckling loads or 
                moments. 
            Distortional Buckling. A mode of buckling involving change in cross-sectional shape, excluding 
               local buckling. 
                   Distortional buckling involves both translation and potentially rotation at the fold line 
                of a member. Distortional buckling involves distortion of one portion of the cross-section 
                and predominantly rigid response of a second portion. For instance, the edge-stiffened 
                flanges of the lipped C-section in Figure C-2.2.1-1 are primarily responding as a rigid 
                cross-section while the web is distorting. Distortional buckling occurs at a buckling half-
                wavelength (L crd ) intermediate to local and global buckling modes. The half-wavelength 
                is typically several times larger than the largest characteristic dimension of the member; 
                however, L crd  is highly dependent on both the loading and the geometry. For some 
                members, distortional buckling may not occur. Bracing can be effective in retarding 
                distortional buckling and boosting the strength of a member. 
            Global Buckling. A mode of buckling that does not involve distortion of the cross-section. The 
               global buckling includes the following buckling modes:   
                Flexural Buckling. Buckling mode in which a compression member deflects laterally 
                   without twist or change in cross-sectional shape. 
                Torsional Buckling. Buckling mode in which a compression member twists about its shear 
                   center axis. 
                Flexural-Torsional Buckling. Buckling mode in which a compression member bends and 
                   twists simultaneously without change in cross-sectional shape.

                Lateral-Torsional Buckling. Buckling mode of a flexural member involving deflection out of 
                   the plane of bending occurring simultaneously with twist about the shear center of 
                   the cross-section. 
                   For columns, global buckling modes include flexural, torsional and flexural-torsional 
                buckling. For beams bent about their strong-axis, lateral-torsional buckling is the global 
                buckling mode of interest. Figure C-2.2.1-1 illustrates the uncoupled global buckling 
                modes; but for the singly-symmetric section illustrated, the strong-axis flexure (x) and 
                torsion (t) are coupled as two flexural-torsional buckling modes. Global buckling modes 
                involve translation (flexure) and/or rotation (torsion) of the entire cross-section. No 
                distortion exists in any of the elements in the cross-section. The global buckling half-
                wavelength is equal to the unbraced length (L x , L y  or L t ). Bracing can be effective in 
                retarding global buckling and boosting the member strength. 
           
            2.2.2 Summary of Available Numerical Solution Methods 
            Finite Strip Analysis 
               The semi-analytical Finite Strip Method is a numerical solution utilizing plate bending 
            strips to discretize a cold-formed steel cross-section. For a model with simply supported end 
            boundary conditions, a finite strip buckling analysis leads to the member’s signature curve 
            which provides the local, distortional, and global elastic buckling loads or moments as needed in 
            the Specification. Each buckling mode is associated with a particular cross-section shape and a 
            buckling half-wavelength that together provide a complete description of the buckling mode. 
            An example signature curve for a lipped channel in pure compression is provided in Figure 
            C-2.2.2-1, and additional examples are provided in Figure C-2.2.2-2. 
               Finite strip analysis is a specialized variant of the Finite Element Method. For elastic 
            stability of cold-formed steel structures, it is one of the most efficient and popular methods. 
            Cheung and Tham (1998) explain the basic theory while Hancock et al. (2001) and Ádány and 
            Schafer (2006) provide specific details for stability analysis with this method. Hancock and 
            his researchers pioneered the use of finite strip analysis for stability of cold-formed steel 
            members and convincingly demonstrated the important potential of finite strip analysis in 
            both cold-formed steel design and behavior.  
               AISI has sponsored research that, in part, has led to the development of the freely 
            available program, CUFSM, which employs the Finite Strip Method for elastic buckling 
            determination of any cold-formed steel cross-section. The program is available at 
            www.ce.jhu.edu/bschafer/cufsm and runs on both Windows and Mac platforms. Tutorials 
            and examples are available online at the same address. Other programs that provide similar 
            solutions include THIN-WALL (Hancock, 1995), and CFS. Steel Smart System uses an 
            embedded version of CUFSM.

            attachments, and for numerically (and automatically) identifying the local, distortional, and 
            global buckling modes, and other special cases.

            Shell Finite Element Methods 
               Finite element models of cold-formed steel members developed from plate or shell finite 
            elements are capable of providing appropriate buckling solutions for local, distortional, and 
            global buckling. The buckling modes illustrated in Figure C-2.2.1-1 were generated from an 
            eigen-buckling analysis using shell finite elements. Incorporation of specialized details of the 
            section, including holes (as illustrated in Figure C-2.2.2-3(b)), or any other variation along the 
            length, as well as unique end boundary conditions, attachments, etc. are all possible using 
            shell finite element models. In general, the more complicated the situation, the greater the 
            preference for the use of shell finite element-based models. 
               However, categorization of the numerically determined buckling solutions into local, 
            distortional, and global buckling for use in the Specification often requires significant 
            engineering judgment. A typical shell finite element model may require visual evaluation of 
            as many as 100 modes to find the fundamental buckling modes. Buckling modes often appear 
            as coupled, such as in Figure C2.2.2-3(a), further complicating the identification effort. No 
            direct equivalent to the finite strip analysis signature curve exists for shell finite element 
            models. Additional discussion of identification is provided in Commentary Section 2.2.3. 
                





                                                                               (a) Local-Distortional Interacted          (b) Buckling in a Member With a Hole

               Most basic finite element texts for solid mechanics include the full details of thin-plate 
            and thin-shell finite elements appropriate for modeling thin-walled cold-formed steel 
            members (e.g., see Cook et al. (1989), or Zienkiewicz and Taylor (1989, 1991)). Due to the 
            common practice of using linear or polynomial shape functions in the Finite Element Method, 
            the number of elements required for reasonable accuracy can be significant and mesh 
            convergence studies may need to be performed to ensure adequate accuracy, particularly for 
            local buckling modes. 
               A large variety of commercial software provides plate or shell finite elements capable of 
            accurately predicting the elastic buckling modes of cold-formed steel members, including (but 
            not limited to): ABAQUS, ANSYS, MARC, and MSC NASTRAN. 
            Generalized Beam Theory 
               Generalized Beam Theory enriches a standard beam finite element with additional cross-
            section deformation modes consistent with local and distortional buckling and can provide 
            elastic buckling solutions appropriate for use in the Specification. Generalized Beam Theory is 
            capable of generating a member’s signature curve for stability as in Figure C-2.2.2-1. In 
            common implementations, the method is directly comparable to the Finite Strip Method, 
            though generally utilizing less degrees of freedom. Specialized variants of Generalized Beam 
            Theory exist for a variety of member conditions, loading conditions, shear deformations, etc.  
               Generalized Beam Theory originally was developed by Schardt (1989), disseminated by

            Basaglia and Camotim (2013). Research on Generalized Beam Theory remains active. The 
            method provides an explicit ability to separate the different buckling modes, making the 
            approach especially amenable in design. Professor Camotim’s group at University of Lisbon 
            developed the program GBTUL and made it available for Generalized Beam Theory based 
            buckling analysis. Version 2 can be used to analyze members with arbitrary flat-walled cross-
            sections and handles general loading and support conditions (Bebiano et al., 2014). 
            Other Solutions 
               Any numerical method that incorporates plate theory has the potential to provide an 
            accurate elastic buckling solution for cold-formed steel members. For example, beyond finite 
            strip analysis, finite element analysis, and Generalized Beam Theory, finite differences and 
            boundary elements have both been successfully used in related stability problems (e.g., Harik 
            et al. (1991), Elzein, 1991). In addition, many of the analytical solutions provided in 
            Specification Section 2.3 can be generalized and applied as numerical solutions. 
               Beam elements used in typical structural analysis software are not capable of including 
            cross-sectional distortion and thus do not include local buckling or distortional buckling. Beam 
            elements used in typical structural analysis software do not explicitly include warping 
            torsion and thus do not accurately model torsional, flexural-torsional, or lateral-torsional 
            buckling. Beam elements used in typical structural analysis software do not account for 
            torsion demands inherent in sections where the shear center and centroid do not coincide, 
            and thus should be used with care for singly- and un-symmetric sections. 
           
            2.2.3 Numerical Solutions – Identifying Buckling Modes 
               Once a model is constructed in any of the available methods, the appropriate local, 
            distortional, and global buckling modes must be identified. In some cases this can be a 
            challenge; however, it is often easy to identify that a particular buckling mode is higher than a 
            certain value due to the nature of most analyses which report results from the smallest 
            buckling load (moment) to the largest. For all buckling modes—local, distortional, and global—
            if the elastic buckling value is large enough, then the cross-section will develop its full 
            capacity (e.g., the yield moment in bending, M y , or the squash load in compression, P y ). 
            Using the strength prediction equations of the Specification, the following limits can be 
            generated: 
           
            Flexural Members (not considering inelastic reserve) 
              if M cr  > 1.66M y , then no reduction will occur due to local buckling 
              if M crd  > 2.21M y , then no reduction will occur due to distortional buckling 
              if M cre  > 2.78M y , then no reduction will occur due to global buckling 
           
            Compression Members  
              if P cr  > 1.66P y , then no reduction will occur due to local buckling 
              if P crd  > 3.18P y , then no reduction will occur due to distortional buckling 
              if P cre  ≥ 3.97P y , a 10% or less reduction will occur due to global buckling 
              if P cre  ≥ 8.16P y , a 5% or less reduction will occur due to global buckling 
              if P cre  ≥ 41.64P y , a 1% or less reduction will occur due to global buckling

               When considering the limits for local buckling, the given values are conservative, since 
            local buckling interacts with global buckling, M y  and P y  can be replaced by M ne  and P ne  for the 
            local buckling upper-bounds, where M ne  and P ne  are the nominal strengths [resistances] 
            determined in the Specification for global buckling limit states. 
           
            Identification in Finite Strip Analysis 
               Finite strip analysis is generally the preferred tool for predicting elastic buckling, and in 
            some cases identification of the buckling modes is readily apparent. For example, in Figure C-
            2.2.2-1, local buckling is the first minimum in the signature curve, distortional buckling is the 
            second minimum in the signature curve, and global buckling is the final descending branch of 
            the signature curve and can be read directly at the global buckling effective length, KL. This is 
            the ideal scenario. Study of the examples of Figure C-2.2.2-2 indicates that immediate 
            identification from the signature curve is often, but not always, possible. If any buckling mode 
            can be identified to be at a buckling value greater than the preceding limits (e.g.,  
            Pcrd  > 3.18P y ), then further identification of that mode need not be pursued. 
               Finite strip analysis may have indistinct minima in the signature curve. For example, 
            distortional buckling in the Z-section in compression of Figure C-2.2.2-2 is difficult to identify. 
            The basic definitions in Commentary Section 2.2.1 may be used to identify appropriate half-
            wavelengths and cross-section deformations for manual identification of the modes; 
            however, this can be fairly subjective. In some cases (K x Lx  ≠ K y Ly  ≠ K t Lt , or KL < L crd ), it may 
            be easier to use finite strip analysis for local and distortional buckling determination, but use 
            analytical solutions for global buckling. An extension of the Finite Strip Method has been 
            developed that allows for automatic identification and full separation of each mode, termed 
            the constrained Finite Strip Method (Ádány and Schafer, 2008). The method is applied to 
            practical identification of cold-formed steel members in Li and Schafer (2010), is the basis for 
            tabular solutions for lipped channels in CFSEI Tech Note G103-11 (Li and Schafer, 2011), and 
            is provided within the freely available finite strip program CUFSM (Li and Schafer, 2010b). 
            The method is not without its own limitations, and is under active development (Li et al., 
            2013). 
               Another study has shown that numerical evaluation of mode shape displacements can be 
            used to identify buckling modes (Glauz, 2016). This study separates section and axial 
            deformations, and quantifies mode shape deformation work to categorize the buckling mode. 
           
            Identification in Shell Finite Element Models 
               Shell finite element models provide the greatest power and flexibility with respect to 
            construction of a model and calculation of the elastic buckling modes and associated loads 
            (moments). However, shell finite element models provide no tools for identification of the 
            modes, and the process can be subjective, time consuming, and difficult to automate. In 
            general, the modes are ordered from smallest to largest and the analyst must visually 
            investigate each mode. Visual identification proceeds using the basic definitions of 
            Commentary Section 2.2.1, but the process can be somewhat subjective. 
               A conservative approach to identification in shell finite element models is to find the 
            smallest buckling mode that has characteristics similar to a basic definition; for example, 
            flange/lip translation associated with distortional buckling, and assign the buckling load (or 
            moment) to that mode. In some cases, no deformations will be present in the initial results

            that match a given mode (e.g., local buckling in a thicker member). The limits of the preceding 
            section are useful in this process; if any buckling mode can be identified to be at a buckling 
            value greater than the preceding limits (e.g., P cr  > 1.66P y ), then further identification of that 
            mode need not be pursued.  
               Numerical tools that augment shell finite element models and allow for automatic 
            identification are under development (Li et al., 2013). The deformation work method (Glauz, 
            2016) described in Identification in Finite Strip Analysis could be adapted to finite element 
            models for selected cross-sections of the member. 
           
            Identification in Generalized Beam Theory Models 
               The identification of buckling modes in models using Generalized Beam Theory is 
            relatively direct. The analyst determines which deformation modes are to be employed in the 
            model and for any buckling mode can assess to what extent local, distortional, or global buckling 
            modes are engaged based on what deformation modes were included. Models must use 
            sharp corners (no corner radius). 
           
            2.2.4 Numerical Solutions - End Boundary Conditions 
               The semi-analytical Finite Strip Method, which is used to generate the signature curve of 
            Figures C-2.2.2-1 and C-2.2.2-2, is based on ends that are simply supported and warping free. 
            This is consistent with all of the plate buckling solutions traditionally used in the Specification 
            and now provided in Appendix 1. In addition, this is consistent with the boundary conditions 
            used for deriving global buckling modes in Chapter E, Chapter F, and the Analytical Solutions 
            of Appendix 2 in the Specification. Global buckling modes can be modified to account for 
            different end conditions using effective length, KL; a similar method is not available for local 
            and distortional buckling. This is because even in a fixed end member, if the length is great 
            enough, local and distortional buckling will be free to form in the interior of the specimen and 
            will converge to the pinned end (warping free) solution. For local buckling, the length where a 
            fixed-end solution converges to the simply supported value is only three to five times the 
            largest characteristic dimension of the member; however, for distortional buckling the length is 
            greater (see Li and Schafer, 2009). For distortional buckling, an approximate solution to correct 
            the simply supported boundary conditions to account for fixed ends, developed by Moen 
            (2008), is recommended: 
              (P crd )fixed  = D boost (P crd )pinned                                       (C-2.2.4-1) 
                        1L  2
              Dboost  =  1+  crd                                            (C-2.2.4-2) 2 L 
                where 
                Lcrd  = Buckling half-wavelength for distortional buckling with pinned ends 
                L    = Unbraced length of the member with respect to distortional buckling 
               Generally, most available methods can directly model a variety of end boundary 
            conditions. However, if the end conditions are not simply supported, the signature curve 
            cannot be constructed, and identification can be more complicated. For finite strip analysis, 
            CUFSM provides a solution for general end boundary conditions (Li and Schafer, 2010b), 
            GBTUL provides a similar solution for generalized beam theory, and, of course, arbitrary end 
            boundary conditions may be included in shell finite element models.

            2.2.5 Numerical Solutions – Shear Buckling 
               Elastic shear buckling is treated as a separate buckling mode (despite being inextricably tied 
            to moment gradient) and the related shear flow is provided for a lipped channel in Figure C-
            2.2.5-1. Conventional finite strip analysis, Generalized Beam Theory, and even some plate 
            finite element formulations only include the destabilizing effect of longitudinal stresses. 
            Therefore, the Finite Strip Method utilized in CUFSM and the conventional Generalized 
            Beam Theory of GBTUL cannot provide a prediction for shear buckling. 














                                                            
                         Figure C-2.2.5-1  Shear Flow Distributions in a Lipped Channel 
               Available numerical solutions include: (1) a generalized version of the semi-analytical 
            Finite Strip Method (SAFSM) developed by Plank and Wittrick (1974) and implemented in 
            Hancock and Pham (2011), (2) a new version of SAFSM which accounts for the restraint from 
            simply supported ends in the shear mode developed by Hancock and Pham (2013), (3) the 
            Spline Finite Strip Method (SFSM) as developed by Lau and Hancock (1986) and 
            implemented in Pham and Hancock (2009a), or (4) shell finite element models as previously 
            discussed. 
               Members in pure shear can also cause buckling of the whole section in the form of shear 
            local buckling as shown in Figure C-2.2.5-2(a) or shear distortional buckling as shown in Figure 
            C-2.2.5-2(b) depending on the geometry of the section, loading, and restraint. Shear buckling is 
            different from that for compression or bending in that the nodal lines are not perpendicular 
            to the axis of the section as shown for the shear local buckling mode in Figure C-2.2.5-2(a). The 
            modes shown as Semi-Analytical Finite Strip Method (SAFSM) apply to a single half-
            wavelength of an infinitely long section, and those designated as Spline Finite Strip Method 
            (SFSM) apply to a section of finite length with simply supported ends. SFSM results are 
            directly comparable to shell finite element method results. Typically, the local mode 
            dominates at short half-wavelengths, and shear distortional buckling is evident at longer half-
            wavelengths in some instances. The buckling stress versus half-wavelength curves from 
            Hancock and Pham (2011) are shown in Figure C-2.2.5-2(c). The minimum on the SAFSM 
            curve corresponds to the value on the SFSM curve at longer half-wavelengths where end 
            conditions do not affect the buckling.

               Members with holes may be directly modeled using shell finite elements. Identification 
            can be challenging, but model creation and analysis is straightforward (See Figure C-2.2.2-
            3(b)). Generalized Beam Theory is not well suited for handling holes in members, nor is finite

            strip analysis. Spline finite strip analysis has been extended to members with holes (Yao and 
            Rasmussen, 2012), but is not generally available, nor markedly more efficient than shell finite 
            element models. 
               Given the popularity of finite strip analysis, approximate numerical methods have been 
            developed for finding the local, distortional, and global buckling modes of members with holes 
            using finite strip analysis. The methods generally apply to isolated perforations/holes as 
            found in cold-formed steel framing and related applications. Members with flanged or 
            stiffened holes and members with patterned holes (storage racks) currently require a shell finite 
            element model to establish the elastic buckling values. Work is ongoing to provide general 
            simplified methods for these cases in the near future (Grey and Moen, 2011; Casafont et al., 
            2012; Smith and Moen, 2014). In general, the provided methods are complementary to the 
            analytical methods for members with holes provided in Appendix 2 of the Specification. 
           
            Local Buckling of Members With Holes Using Finite Strip Analysis  
               Researchers have observed that holes can change the local buckling mode shapes of thin 
            plates and cold-formed steel columns and beams (Kumai, 1952; Schlack, Jr., 1964; Kawai and 
            Ohtsubo, 1968; Vann, 1971; Kesti, 2000; El-Sawy and Nazmy, 2001; Sarawit, 2003; and Moen 
            and Schafer, 2009b). A finite strip approximate method for predicting P cr  and M cr  including 
            the influence of holes is described in Moen and Schafer (2009c). The method assumes that 
            local buckling occurs as either buckling of the unstiffened strip(s) adjacent to a hole at the net 
            section or as local buckling of the gross section between holes. This approach is an 
            improvement over element-based methods because the interaction between the unstiffened

                      buckling half-wavelengths shorter than the length of the hole 
               To calculate P crh , a finite strip analysis of the net section is performed as shown in Figure 
            C-2.2.6-1. To ensure a consistent comparison of P crh  and P crnh , the reference stress used in 
            the net section and gross section finite strip analyses should be calculated with the same 
            reference load (e.g., 1 kip (4.45 kN) on the net section, 1 kip (4.45 kN) on the gross section).

            is L crh . When the hole length, L h , is less than L crh , as shown in Figure C-2.2.6-2(a), P crh  is 
            equal to the buckling load for a single half-wave forming over the length of the hole. (This 
            case is common for circular and square holes, where L h  is less than the width of the cross-
            sectional element containing the hole.) If L h  ≥ L crh  (Figure C-2.2.6-2(b)), P crh  is the minimum 
            on the buckling curve, corresponding to a single half-wave forming within the length of the 
            hole. Note that use of the net cross-section for buckling half-wavelengths greater than L h  is 
            conservative by failing to reflect the stiffness contributions of the gross section. Knowledge of 
            the specific buckling half-wavelength of interest allows the Finite Strip Method to be extended 
            by utilizing the net section, but only for half-waves less than the length of the hole, L h .

               The same approach described previously for columns is also applicable to beams, i.e., 
            Mcr  =min(M crnh , M crh ). In this case, the applied reference stress in the finite strip analysis 
            should be represented as a moment, i.e., 1 kip-in. (113 kN-mm) on the net section and 1 kip-
            in. (113 kN-mm) on the gross cross-section. See Moen and Schafer (2010b). 
               A similar approach is recommended for patterned type hole patterns. See Smith and 
            Moen (2014) for additional examples and complete details. 
           
            Distortional Buckling of Members With Holes Using Finite Strip Analysis  
               The distortional buckling loads P crd  and M crd  are, at least in part, dictated by the bending 
            stiffness provided by the web of an open cross-section as it restrains the attached flange from 
            rotating (see Figures C-2.2.1-1, C-2.2.2-1 and C-2.2.2-2). If a hole with length L h  is introduced 
            into the web of an open cross-section, the rotational restraint provided by the web is 
            decreased, resulting in a lower critical distortional buckling load (Kesti, 2000; Moen and 
            Schafer, 2009a). An approximate method for calculating P crd  and M crd  including the 
            influence of flat-punched unstiffened web holes has been developed by Moen and Schafer 
            (2009c). To implement the method, a finite strip analysis is performed with the gross cross-
            section to identify the distortional buckling half-wavelength, L crd . Then, the web thickness is 
            modified from t to t r  to simulate the reduction in bending stiffness caused by the presence of 
            a web hole, where:

                    Lcrd 
            and L h  is the length of the hole. Note that the cross-sectional thickness is modified over the 
            full depth of the web, not just at the location of the hole in the cross-section. The buckling load 
            Pcrd  or M crd  (including the influence of holes) is obtained with another finite strip analysis of 
            the modified cross-section performed just at L crd  of the gross cross-section with the reduced 
            thickness. The second analysis is only conducted at L crd  as this is the only length for which 
            the reduced thickness t r  has any relevance. This finite strip elastic buckling simplified method 
            is only appropriate for the case of flat-punched discrete holes in the web or flange (or both). 
               For patterned holes, as detailed in Smith and Moen (2014), a different reduction is required, 
            specifically: 
                            3/1 A      tt r =  web                                                (C-2.2.6-3)  A        web,gross 
            where t is the thickness of the web, A web,net  is the net area of the web, and A web,gross  is the 
            gross area of the web. Since the reduction is along the full length of the member, the model, 
            with modified thickness, should be completed along the full length of the member. A new 
            finite strip analysis is conducted to find the new L crd  and resulting buckling load, P crd . The 
            model should be loaded with a reference force to account for the reduced area due to the 
            holes. This method has been validated for compressive members and is recommended for use 
            with flexural members as well. 
           
            Global Buckling of Members With Holes Using Finite Strip Analysis  
               A general approach to including the influence of holes for global buckling in a finite strip 
            analysis is not available. Bending rigidities EIx  and EI y , torsion rigidity GJ, and warping 
            rigidity EC w  each require different reductions in the section to provide the appropriate 
            reduced properties to account for the holes. For example, the reduced thickness needed to 
            provide I x,avg , J avg , and C w,net  as discussed in the Specification Sections 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.1 for 
            analytical solutions are all different—since these rigidities are typically coupled, one finite 
            strip model cannot have two different thickness reductions. As a result, the analytical 
            solutions of Specification Sections 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.1, as developed by Moen and Schafer 
            (2009c), are preferred, or shell finite element models may be used directly. Note that the 
            section property calculator in CUFSM does provide a convenient means to calculate the 
            necessary average and net properties. 
           
            2.2.7 Numerical Solutions – Bracing and Attachments 
               Bracing and other attachments to a member (sheathing, sheeting, etc.) can have a 
            significant impact on the elastic buckling load (moment, etc.) of a member. Thus, it is often 
            desirable to include such additional elements in the elastic buckling analysis. The most 
            common method is the inclusion of a spring. However, it is possible in shell finite element 
            models to make complete models of a member and its relevant bracing and attachments, and 
            then perform the elastic buckling analysis. 
               Bracing, or attachments made with fasteners, typically occur with a discrete spacing. This 
            spacing is highly relevant when considering the impact of the bracing on the various buckling

            modes. Every buckling mode has a characteristic buckling half-wavelength (Figure C-2.2.2-2). If 
            bracing or attachment is introduced to the member at a shorter length than this L cr , then it 
            may be beneficial to include this support in the elastic buckling prediction. For local buckling, 
            Lcr  is short, and it is uncommon to have tight enough fastener spacing to significantly 
            impact the mode. For distortional and global buckling typical fastener spacing is relevant, and 
            bracing and attachments should be included. 
               For distortional buckling, bracing or attachments that restrict rotation at the web/flange 
            juncture are typically of greatest importance. Commentary Section 2.3.3.3 provides a complete 
            discussion of methods for determination of the relevant rotational stiffness. Such stiffness 
            may be modeled discretely in shell finite element models, or smeared into foundation 
            stiffness (along the length) for use in a finite strip analysis. Depending on the 
            implementation, Generalized Beam Theory may use either the discrete or smeared stiffness 
            method. 
               Significant effort has been directed at determining the restraining effect of sheathing on 
            wall studs (Vieira and Schafer, 2013; Peterman and Schafer, 2014; and Schafer, 2013). The 
            work specifically details methods for conversion of attached sheathing into springs 
            appropriate for use in shell finite element models and finite strip models for elastic buckling 
            determination. The work has wide potential applicability. New guidelines and procedures 
            are expected in the near future. 
           
            2.2.8 Numerical Solutions – Moment Gradient or Stress Gradient 
               Moment gradient influences the elastic buckling of a section. For shell finite element 
            models, it is possible to explicitly model the loading conditions and include moment 
            gradient. For Generalized Beam Theory, inclusion of moment gradient is also possible and is 
            available in Version 2 of GBTUL. 
               Finite strip analysis typically does not include moment gradient (a constant moment is 
            assumed). For local buckling, due to the short half-wavelength of the buckling mode, moment 
            gradient only has a minor influence and no correction needs to be made. For distortional 
            buckling, the moment gradient will increase the buckling moment, and β of Specification 
            Equation 2.3.3.3-3 may be applied to increase the result from a finite strip analysis. For global 
            buckling, the moment gradient is also beneficial, and C b  of Specification Equation F2.1.1-2 may 
            be applied.  
           
            2.2.9 Numerical Solutions—Members With Variation Along Length 
               Shell finite element models are best suited for handling unusual members with significant 
            variation along the length. In some cases, conservative simplifications using finite strip 
            analysis or Generalized Beam Theory are possible. 
           
            2.2.10 Numerical Solutions – Built-Up Sections and Assemblages 
               Elastic buckling of built-up sections may be explicitly considered with shell finite element 
            models. Care must be taken to ensure the end boundary conditions are realistic and that 
            appropriate stiffness is selected for the attachments between members. Finite strip analysis 
            may be used if it is appropriate to smear the attachments along the length of the member—
            see Schafer (2013) for a related discussion. Research is underway to develop improved elastic 
            buckling prediction methods for built-up sections.

               In some cases, it is both possible and desirable to treat an assemblage as a member—such 
            as trusses, wall panels, and floor systems—for elastic buckling determination. Common 
            practice is to model such assemblages with traditional beam finite elements. Care must be 
            taken with this approach, since local, distortional, and often flexural-torsional buckling are not 
            present in typical beam element models. Secondary models will be required to capture these 
            buckling modes. Shell finite element models do provide a means to include complete 
            assemblage information, but with added complexity. 
           
          2.3  Analytical Solutions 
             The Specification provides analytical solutions for elastic buckling of typical cold-formed steel 
          cross-sections. Additional analytical solutions may be found in the SSRC Guide (Ziemian, 2010), 
          the Direct Strength Method Design Guide (AISI, 2006), as well as other reference texts (Allen and 
          Bulson, 1980; Chajes, 1974; and Timoshenko and Gere, 1961). The use of alternative analytical 
          formulae for elastic buckling determination falls under the rational engineering analysis clause of 
          Chapter A. 
             Many of the analytical solutions provided are relatively complex due to the lack of 
          symmetry and the thin-walled nature of typical cold-formed steel members. In general, 
          numerical solutions, as detailed in Specification Section 2.2, can provide efficient predictions for 
          arbitrary cross-sections, boundary conditions, and loading conditions, and thus are 
          recommended whenever practical. Also, for common sections, elastic buckling solutions are 
          tabulated in the AISI Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013) and in CFSEI Tech Note 
          G103-11 (Li and Schafer, 2011).    
           
            2.3.1 Members Subject to Compression 
              2.3.1.1  Global Buckling (F cre , P cre ) 

                 Formulae for global flexural, torsional, and flexural-torsional buckling are provided in 
              Specification Section E2. For a general non-symmetric section, analytical formulae were 
              previously only available in the AISI Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013). In 2016, 
              the general solution for global elastic buckling was provided in this section of the 
              Specification. Derivation of the solution is provided in Timoshenko and Gere (1961), and 
              other common reference texts (e.g., Yu and LaBoube, 2010). 
                 The advantage of the provided formulae is that they are applicable to any cross-section 
              including those covered in Specification Section E2. Therefore, if programmed, they provide 
              a general solution. The disadvantage of the formulae is that they are complex. Roots of a 
              cubic equation are required as are torsional cross-section properties that may not be 
              commonly available. The AISI Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013) provides 
              examples for calculation of these cross-section properties. In general, the torsion-related 
              cross-section properties may be found from the following:

              2.3.1.2   Local Buckling (F cr , P cr ) 

                 Local buckling is synonymous with plate buckling, and the classic plate buckling 
              expression is: 
                        π2 E   t 2
                F              cr  =  k      )1(12   2                                        (Eq. C-2.3.1.2-1)  µ−   w
                 This equation is used extensively in the Specification. For the Effective Width Method 
              detailed in Appendix 1, Equation 1.1-4 uses F cr  directly to determine the slenderness of an 
              element, which in turn is used to find the effective width of the element. For every type of 
              element and for different stress gradients on the elements, different solutions are provided 
              for the plate buckling coefficient, k, in Appendix 1.  
                 For example, consider a lipped channel in compression with web depth, h = 8.94 in. 
              (227.1 mm), flange width, b = 2.44 in. (62.00 mm), lip length d = 0.744 in. (18.88 mm), and t 
              = 0.059 in. (1.499 mm) (and ignoring corner radius for this example). In this case: 
              Lip:     k = 0.43, F cr-lip   = 0.43[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/d) 2  = 72.1 ksi (497 MPa) 
              Flange:  k ≈ 4, F cr-flange  = 4.0[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/b) 2  = 62.4 ksi (430 MPa) 
              Web:    k = 4, F cr-web  = 4.0[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/h) 2  = 4.6 ksi (32.0 MPa) 
              Each separate local buckling stress is used for determining the element effective width. 
                 However, if the Direct Strength Method given in Specification Section E3.2 is used for 
              finding the local buckling strength, the local buckling load, P cr , not stress, F cr  is required. 
              Obviously, the three separate element (plate) solutions predict three separate P cr . The 
              Specification requires using the minimum F cr , thus the web local buckling stress would be 
              used in the preceding example. 
                 In this example, the web local buckling stress is significantly lower than the other 
              elements. The User Note in the Specification Section 2.3.1.2 warns that in this case, 
              prediction of P cr  based on the minimum F cr  may be very conservative. In this example, 
              the flange provides beneficial restraint to the web that can be accounted for. The DSM 
              Design Guide (Schafer, 2006) provides additional discussion, and improved analytical 
              formulas are available (Schafer, 2001 and 2002; and Schafer and Peköz, 1999). However, for 
              direct numerical solutions or tabulated numerical solutions, the AISI Cold-Formed Steel 
              Design Manual (AISI, 2013) and CFSEI Tech Note G103-11 (Li and Schafer, 2011) are 
              preferred since they can readily account for the interaction of the elements. 
              2.3.1.3   Distortional Buckling (F crd , P crd ) 

                 The expressions employed in Specification Section 2.3.1.3 are derived in Schafer (2002) 
              and verified for complex stiffeners in Schafer et al. (2006). The equations used for the 
              distortional buckling stress in AS/NZS 4600 (1996) are similar, except that when the web is

              very slender and is restrained by the flange, AS/NZS 4600 formulae use a simpler, 
              conservative treatment. Since the provided expressions can be complicated, solutions for 
              the geometric properties of C- and Z-sections based on centerline dimensions are provided 
              in Specification Table 2.3.1.3-1. More refined values including corner radius are possible and 
              permitted. 
                 In many cases, the flange will have full or partial rotational restraint due to attachment 
              to a brace, panel, or sheeting. In this case the appropriate rotational stiffness, k φ , from the 
              restraining elements may be added to the solution. The Commentary Section 2.3.3.3 
              provides additional details on k φ  and its determination. 
                 Application of the method is involved and examples are provided in the AISI Cold-
              Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013). While numerical methods or tabulated solutions 
              from numerical methods (CFSEI Tech Note G103-11 by Li and Schafer, 2011) are generally 
              preferred, a simplified method was provided until 2010 in the Specification. In 2010, the 
              simplified approach was moved to the Commentary (as shown below), reflecting the intent 
              that the method be used in preliminary design only, as it intentionally provides a lower 
              bound solution.    
              Simplified Method for Unrestrained C- and Z-Sections With Simple Lip Stiffeners 
                 For C- and Z-sections that have no rotational restraint of the flange and that are within 
              the dimensional limits provided in this section, Equation C-2.3.1.3-1 can be used to 
              calculate a conservative prediction of distortional buckling stress, F crd , provided the 
              following dimensional limits are met: 
                (1) 50 ≤ h o /t ≤ 200, 
                (2) 25 ≤ b o /t ≤ 100,

                2.3.2.1.1 Sections With Holes Not Subject to Torsional or Flexural-Torsional Buckling  
                   The global flexural buckling load decreases when holes are present (Sarawit, 2003; 
                Moen and Schafer, 2009a). This is due to a reduction in the bending rigidity, EI, due to 
                the presence of the holes. The “weighted average” approach to determination of the 
                moment of inertia as used in Specification Table 2.3.2-1 has been shown to provide 
                sufficient accuracy when compared with numerical solutions (Moen and Schafer, 2009c). 
                   If the holes are not spaced uniformly about the mid-height of the column, then a 
                more precise approximation of I

                2.3.2.1.2 Doubly- or Singly-Symmetric Sections (With Holes) Subject to Torsional or 
                       Flexural-Torsional Buckling  
                   The “weighted average” approach for flexural buckling can be extended to the general 
                case of flexural-torsional buckling as described in Moen and Schafer (2009c). The key 
                extensions are the determination of the influence of holes on torsion rigidities: GJ and 
                EC w  and the distances between the shear center and centroid, x o  and y o  along the 
                corresponding principal axes, and related polar radius of gyration r o . The form of the 
                “weighted average” employed for flexural rigidity EI is found to also work for GJ, and a 
                Javg  approximation is provided in Specification Table 2.3.2-1 as well. Similar “weighted 
                average” approximations are provided for x o , y o , and r o . The warping torsion rigidity, 
                EC w , does not follow the “weighted average” approximation, as the presence of holes 
                prevents warping resistance from developing (Moen and Schafer, 2009c). A viable 
                approximation for warping stiffness at the net section is EC w,net .  
                   Some care must be exercised in the use of average vs. gross area. The buckling load is 
                derived based on the cross-section rigidities: EI, GJ, and EC w  and the buckling load is 
                independent of the cross-sectional area. Therefore, conversion to buckling stress uses the 
                gross cross-sectional area if the rigidities have been properly reduced to account for holes. 
                Average cross-sectional area is only necessary for calculating the radius of gyration since 
                this quantity is directly tied to the rigidities. 
                   Note that all net section properties, i.e., I x,net , I y,net , A net , x o,net , y o,net , J net , and 
                Cw,net , can be readily calculated with the built-in section property calculator in the freely 
                available open source program CUFSM (Schafer and Ádány, 2006) by setting the 
                element thicknesses to zero at the holes. See Moen and Schafer (2010a). 
                   Also note that based on the hole distribution, it may be feasible to take the 
                conservative approach of using the net section properties instead of the average 
                properties. Similarly, for certain hole distributions, it is reasonable to assume that holes 
                are symmetric about the longitudinal mid-height and use the equations provided in the 
                Specification.

                2.3.2.1.3 Point Symmetric Sections With Holes  
                   The provided method for point symmetric sections with holes is a direct extension of 
                the method without holes. 
           
                2.3.2.1.4 Non-Symmetric Sections With Holes  
                   Similar to Specification Section 2.3.1.1, Specification Section 2.3.2.1.4 provides a general 
                analytical solution for flexural-torsional buckling. The method is a direct extension of 
                Specification Section 2.3.2.1.2 and may be used for any cross-section. 
              2.3.2.2  Local Buckling (F cr , P cr ) for Members With Holes 

                 As an extension to the example of Commentary Section 2.3.1.2, consider the same lipped 
              channel in compression with web depth, h = 8.94 in. (227.1 mm); flange width, b = 2.44 in. 
              (62.0 mm); lip length, d = 0.744 in. (18.9 mm); and thickness, t = 0.059 in. (1.50 mm); and 
              now a 4-in. (102-mm) deep hole is located at the mid-depth of the web (again, ignoring 
              corner radius). The unstiffened elements at the hole net section have width a = (h – 4 in.)/2 
              = 2.47 in. (62.7 mm), and the A net  = 0.66 in 2  (430 mm 2 ) and A g  = 0.90 in 2  (583 mm 2 ). The 
              Fcr  are: 
              lip:       k = 0.43, f cr-lip   = 0.43[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/d) 2  = 72.1 ksi (497 MPa) 
              flange:    k ≈ 4, f cr-flange  = 4.0[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/b) 2  = 62.4 ksi (430 MPa) 
              web:      k = 4, f cr-web  = 4.0[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/h) 2  = 4.6 ksi (32.0 MPa) 
              web at hole: k = 0.43,  f cr-web  = 0.43[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](t/a) 2 (A net /A g ) = 4.8 ksi (33.3 MPa) 
              In this case, the net section does not control at the hole and the web local buckling stress away 
              from the hole would still be multiplied by A g  to determine P cr . In this case, a smaller hole 
              would have actually reduced the buckling stress at the hole location, e.g. a 2-in. (50.8-mm) 
              hole yields a net section local buckling stress lower than away from the hole. Mitigating this 
              circumstance is the fact that the net section squash load changes as well, and for the net 
              section squash load, smaller holes are always better. Numerical methods may provide 
              superior solutions since they can account for the beneficial restraint provided by the 
              attached elements and can account for details such as edge-stiffened holes, etc. 
              2.3.2.3   Distortional Buckling (F crd , P crd ) for Members With Holes 

                 The distortional buckling load P crd  is, at least in part, dictated by the bending stiffness 
              provided by the web of an open cross-section as it restrains the attached flange from 
              rotating (see Figure C-2.2.6-1). If a hole with length L h  is introduced into the web of an open 
              cross-section, the rotational restraint provided by the web is decreased, resulting in a 
              smaller critical distortional buckling load (Kesti, 2000; Moen and Schafer, 2009a). 
                 An approximate method developed for calculating P crd  including the influence of flat-
              punched unstiffened web holes for finite strip analysis has been developed by Moen and 
              Schafer (2009c) and adapted here for use in Specification Section 2.3.2.3. The key to the 
              method is the reduction of the bending stiffness of the web. This is completed by modifying 
              the web thickness from t to t r . This modification is only required for the rotational stiffness 
              terms; correction of the distortional buckling half-wavelength, L crd , is not required. 
                 A similar reduction may also be applied to members that have patterned perforations

              along the full length of the web (Smith and Moen, 2014). In this case, the reduced stiffness is 
              not only at the hole location but throughout the length of the member. 
           
            2.3.3 Members Subject to Flexure 
              2.3.3.1   Global Buckling (F cre , M cre ) 

                 Global (lateral-torsional) buckling is discussed extensively in Commentary Section F2.1(B). 
              It is worth noting that for lateral-torsional buckling of doubly- and singly-symmetric cross-
              sections, Specification Section F2.1.1 provides the most general solution available in the 
              Specification; however, completely general solutions for unsymmetic sections, similar to 
              Section 2.3.1.1 for columns, have been derived (Peköz and Winter, 1969a; Peköz and Celebi, 
              1969b, Yu and LaBoube, 2010).  
              2.3.3.2  Local Buckling (F cr , M cr ) 

                 The local buckling moment, M cr , is determined using the same–minimum of the 
              elements–approach as used for columns in Specification Section 2.3.1.2. M cr  is required for 
              the Direct Strength Method of Specification Section F3.2 and may be approximated from the 
              element local buckling stress. Note that the Effective Width Method of Specification Section F3.1 
              and Appendix 1 utilizes the element local bucking stress directly and ignores interaction 
              amongst the elements. 
                 Since it is a common practice to determine element local buckling stress utilizing the flat 
              portion of a cross-section, for a member under a stress gradient, elements do not have a 
              common reference location. Consider major-axis bending of a braced lipped channel with a 
              7.8-in. (198-mm) deep web (or overall 8-in. (203-mm) deep), 2.3-in. (58.4-mm) wide flange, 
              0.068-in. (1.73-mm) thick, and an outer corner radius of 0.10 in. (2.54 mm). Consider only 
              the flange and web for this example (ignore the lip). From Specification Appendix 1, the plate 
              buckling coefficients, k, would be found and are approximated here to be 23.9 for the web 
              and 4.0 for the flange.  
              Flange: k = 4,  F cr-flange   = 4.0[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](0.068/2.3) 2  = 93.2 ksi (643 MPa) 
                       F cr-flange-ext  = (F cr-flange )(4/(4 - 0.068/2)) = 94.0 ksi (648 MPa) 
              Web:  k = 23.9,  F cr-web    = 23.9[π2 E/(12(1-µ2 ))](0.068/7.8) 2 = 48.4 ksi (334 MPa) 
                                           F cr-web-ext   = (F cr-web )(4/(4 - 0.10)) = 49.7 ksi (342 MPa) 
              where F cr-flange  and F cr-web  are the local buckling stresses of the flange and the web, 
              respectively; and F cr-flange-ext  and F cr-web-ext  are the corresponding stresses referenced to 
              the extreme compression fiber, respectively. 
                 The results show that the web controls, as 49.7 ksi (342 MPa) is less than 94.0 ksi (648 
              ksi). Therefore, the web local buckling stress, referenced to the extreme compression fiber is 
              the governing F cr , and may be multiplied by the gross section modulus to estimate M cr . 
              2.3.3.3   Distortional Buckling (F crd , M crd ) 

                 The expressions employed here are derived in Schafer (2002) and verified for complex 
              stiffeners in Schafer et al. (2006). The equations used for the distortional buckling stress in 
              AS/NZS 4600 (1996) are similar, except that when the web is very slender and is restrained 
              by the flange, AS/NZS 4600 uses a simpler, conservative treatment. Since the provided 
              expressions can be complicated, solutions for the geometric properties of C- and Z-sections

              based on centerline dimensions are provided in Appendix 2 Table 2.3.1.3-1; more refined 
              values including corner radius are possible and permitted. 
                 Application of the method is involved and examples are provided in the AISI Cold-
              Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013). Numerical methods or tabulated solutions from 
              numerical methods in CFSEI Tech Note G103-11 (Li and Schafer, 2011) is often preferred. 
              (a) k φ  Determination 
                 In many cases, the flange will have full or partial rotational restraint due to attachment 
              to a brace, panel, or sheeting. In this case the appropriate rotational stiffness, k φ , from the 
              restraining element(s) may be added to the solution. While it is always conservative to 
              ignore the rotational restraint, k φ , in most cases it is beneficial to include this effect. Due to 
              the large variety of possible conditions, no specific method is provided for determining the 
              rotational restraint. 
                 For framing applications: studs, joists, girts, etc. sheathed with plywood, OSB, or 
              gypsum board, AISI S240 provides provisions for determining k φ  developed based on 
              mechanics and testing (Schafer, Sangree and Guan 2007 and 2008; Schafer et al. 2010). For 
              metal building applications: purlins and girts with through-fastened sheathing (both with 
              and without insulation), Gao and Moen (2012) provide a method for determining k φ  
              confirmed by testing. As reference, past testing on 8-in. and 9.5-in. (203-mm and 241-mm) 
              deep Z-sections with a thickness between 0.069 in. (1.75 mm) and 0.118 in. (3.00 mm), 
              through-fastened 12 in. (205 mm) o.c., to a 36-in. (914 mm) wide, 1-in. (25.4 mm) and 1.5-in. 
              (38.1 mm) high steel panels, with up to 6 in. (152 mm) of blanket insulation between the 
              panel and the Z-section, results in a k φ  between 0.15 to 0.44 kip-in./rad./in. (0.667 to 1.96 
              kN-mm/rad./mm) (MRI, 1981).  
                 Additional testing on C- and Z-sections with pairs of through-fasteners provides 
              considerably higher rotational stiffness: for 6-in. and 8-in. (152-mm and 203-mm) deep C-
              sections with a thickness between 0.054 and 0.097 in. (1.27 and 2.46 mm), fastened with 
              pairs of fasteners on each side of a 1.25-in. (31.8-mm) high steel panel flute at 12 in. (305 
              mm) o.c., k φ  is 0.4 kip-in./rad./in. (1.78 kN-mm/rad./mm); and for 8.5-in. (216-mm) deep 
              Z-sections with a thickness between 0.070 in. and 0.120 in. (1.78 mm to 3.05 mm), fastened 
              with pairs of fasteners on each side of 1.25 in. (31.8 mm) high steel panel flute at 12 in. (305 
              mm) o.c., k φ  is 0.8 kip-in./rad./in. (3.56 kN-mm/rad./mm) (Yu and Schafer, 2003; Yu, 
              2005).  
                 Test determination of k φ  may use AISI S901 (AISI, 2013g). K from this method is a 
              lower bound estimate of k φ . The member lateral deformation may be removed from the 
              measured lateral deformation to provide a more accurate estimate of k φ  as detailed in 
              Schafer, Sangree and Guan, 2008; and Schafer et al., 2010. 
              (b) Moment Gradient 
                 The presence of moment gradient can also increase the distortional buckling moment. 
              However, this increase is lessened if the moment gradient occurs over a longer length. 
              Thus, in determining the influence of moment gradient, β, the ratio of the end moments, 
              M1 /M 2 , and the ratio of the critical distortional buckling length to the unbraced length, 
              L/L m , should both be accounted for. In 2010, the sign convention on the ratio of moments 
              M1  and M 2  was changed to be consistent with moment gradient expressions for C TF  
              (Specification Equation F2.1.2-3) and C m  (Specification Equation in Section C1) used

              elsewhere in the Specification. Specification Equation 2.3.3.3-3 and Commentary Equation C-
              2.3.3.3-2 were revised accordingly. Yu (2005) performed elastic buckling analysis with shell 
              finite element models of C- and Z-sections under different moment gradients to examine 
              this problem. Significant scatter exists in the results; therefore, a lower bound prediction 
              (Specification Equation 2.3.3.3-3) for the increase was selected. 
              (c) Simplified Method for Unrestrained C- and Z-Sections With Simple Lip Stiffeners 
                 Due to the complexity of the expressions, a simplified method was provided until 2010 
              in the Specification. In 2010, the simplified approach was moved to the Commentary, 
              reflecting the intent that the method be used in preliminary design only–as it intentionally 
              provides a lower bound solution. For C- and Z-sections that have no rotational restraint of 
              the compression flange and are within the dimensional limits provided in this section, 
              Equation C-2.3.3.3-1 can be used to calculate a conservative prediction of the distortional 
              buckling stress, F crd . See Specification Section 2.3.3.3 or 2.2 for alternative provisions and for 
              members outside the dimensional limits.  
                 The following dimensional limits apply: 
                (1) 50 ≤ h o /t ≤ 200, 
                (2) 25 ≤ b o /t ≤ 100, 
                (3) 6.25 < D/t ≤ 50, 
                (4) 45° ≤ θ < 90°, 
                (5) 2 ≤ h o /b o  ≤ 8, and 
                (6) 0.04 ≤ D sinθ/b o  ≤ 0.5.

              2.3.4.1  Global Buckling (F cre , M cre ) for Members With Holes 

                 The “weighted average” method is also applicable to cold-formed steel beams with 
              holes. Bending rigidity (EI), St. Venant torsion rigidity (GJ), shear center location (x o  and 
              yo),  and polar radius of gyration (r o ), all are reduced based on average properties as 
              detailed in Specification and Commentary Section 2.3.2.1. Only warping torsion rigidity 
              (ECw ) directly employs the net section as detailed in Commentary Section 2.3.2.1.  
              2.3.4.2  Local Buckling (F cr , M cr ) for Members With Holes 

                 Local buckling for flexural members with hole(s) in the web follows the same approach 
              as for compression members, as detailed in the Commentary Section 2.3.2.2. When the net 
              section with the hole is checked for local buckling, the unstiffened element buckling stress 
              should be multiplied by the net section modulus and divided by the gross section modulus 
              to develop the approximate stress on the gross cross-section. This stress can then be 
              referenced to the extreme compression fiber and compared with all other elements. 
              2.3.4.3  Distortional Buckling (F crd , M crd ) for Members With Holes 

                 Distortional buckling for flexural members with hole(s) in the web follows the same 
              approach as for compressive members, as detailed in Commentary Section 2.3.2.3. 
            2.3.5 Shear Buckling (V cr ) 

               Traditionally, the shear buckling stress and its resultant (shear buckling force) are based on 
            the web alone ignoring interaction from the flanges, and are consistent with Section G2.3 of the 
            Specification. For C- and Z-sections, Specification Section 2.3.5 provides a more refined 
            calculation based on the work of Aswegan and Moen (2012). Pham and Hancock (2011) also

          APPENDIX A, COMMENTARY ON PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE UNITED STATES AND 
                     MEXICO 
             This commentary on Appendix A provides a record of reasoning behind, and justification 
          for, provisions that are applicable to the United States and Mexico. The format used herein is 
          consistent with that used in Appendix A of the Specification. 
           
                                                                                  
              I6.2.2 Flexural Members Having One Flange Fastened to a Standing Seam Roof System 
                 For beams supporting a standing seam roof system, e.g., a roof purlin subjected to dead 
              plus live load, or uplift from wind load, the bending capacity is greater than the bending 
              strength of an unbraced member and may be equal to the bending strength of a fully 
              braced member. The bending capacity is governed by the nature of the loading, gravity or 
              uplift, and the nature of the particular standing seam roof system. Due to the availability of 
              many different types of standing seam roof systems, an analytical method for determining 
              positive and negative bending capacities has not been developed at the present time. 
              However, in order to resolve this issue relative to the gravity loading condition, Section 
              I6.2.2 was added in the 1996 edition of the AISI Specification for determining the nominal 
              flexural strength [resistance] of beams having one flange fastened to a standing seam roof 
              system. In Specification Equation I6.2.2-1, the reduction factor, R, can be determined by  
              AISI S908. Application of the base test method for uplift loading was subsequently 
              validated after further analysis of the research results. 
                 The provisions of Specification Section H4, Combined Bending and Torsion, should not 
              be used in combination with the bending provisions in Specification Section I6.2.2 since 
              these provisions are based on tests in which torsional effects are present. 
                                                                                  
              I6.2.4 Z-Section Compression Members Having One Flange Fastened to a Standing Seam 
                   Roof 
                 The strength of axially loaded Z-sections having one flange attached to a standing seam 
              roof may be limited by either a combination of torsional buckling and lateral buckling in the 
              plane of the roof, or by flexural buckling in a plane perpendicular to the roof. As in the case 
              of Z-sections carrying gravity or wind loads as beams, the roof diaphragm and purlin clips 
              provide a degree of torsional and lateral bracing restraint that is significant, but not 
              necessarily sufficient, to develop the full strength of the cross-section.  
                 Specification Equation I6.2.4-1 predicts the lateral buckling strength using an ultimate 
              axial buckling stress (k af RF y ) that is a percentage of the ultimate flexural stress (RF y ) 
              determined from uplift tests performed using AISI S908, Base Test Method for Purlins 
              Supporting a Standing Seam Roof System, as published by AISI (2013f). This equation, 
              developed by Stolarczyk, et al. (2002), was derived empirically from elastic finite element 
              buckling studies and calibrated to the results of a series of tests comparing flexural and 
              axial strengths using the uplift “Base Test” setup. The full unreduced cross-sectional area, A, 
              has been used rather than the effective area, A e , because the ultimate axial stress is generally 
              not large enough to result in a significant reduction in the effective area for common cross-
              section geometries. 
                 Specification Equation I6.2.4-1 may be used with the results of uplift “Base Tests”

              conducted with and without discrete point bracing. There is no limitation on the minimum 
              length because Equation I6.2.4-1 is conservative for spans that are smaller than those tested 
              under the “Base Test” provisions. 
                 The strength of longer members may be governed by axial buckling perpendicular to the 
              roof; consequently, the provisions of Specification Sections E2 and E2.1 should also be 
              checked for buckling about the strong axis. 
                                                                                  
              I6.3.1a  Strength of Standing Seam Roof Panel Systems 
                 The introduction of the wind uplift loading required strength factor of 0.67 was a result 
              of research conducted to correlate the static uplift capacity represented by tests performed 
              in accordance with AISI S906 and the dynamic behavior of real wind, by Surry, et al. 
              (2007). This research utilized two separate methods of comparison. The first method 
              utilized full-scale tests conducted at Mississippi State University (MSU) using simulated 
              wind loads on a portion of a standing seam metal roof. The second method utilized model-
              scale wind tunnel tests carried out at the University of Western Ontario of an aeroelastic 
              “failure” model of the same roof system. In spite of these significantly different 
              approaches, the results obtained were very consistent. It was found that the ASTM E1592 
              uniform pressure test contains conservatism of about 50 percent for the roof system tested 
              by both approaches, and up to about 80 percent for the other roof systems tested only at 
              MSU. This conservatism arises if the roof system is required to withstand the code-
              recommended pressure applied as uniform pressure in the ASTM E1592 test, without 
              accounting for the reality of the dynamic spatially-varying properties of the wind-induced 
              pressures. The limits of applicability of this factor (panel thickness and width) are 
              conservatively listed based on the scope of the research. The failure mode is restricted to 
              those failures associated with the load in the clip because this was how the research 
              measured and compared the static and dynamic capacities. Therefore, the 2012 Specification 
              was clarified with respect to the strength factor of 0.67 applying to the clips and fasteners 
              as well as the standing seam roof panels. The required strength factor of 0.67 is not 
              permitted to be used with other observed failures. In addition, the research does not 
              support or confirm whether interpolation would be appropriate between ASTM E1592 
              tests of the same roof system with different spans, where one test meets the requirements, 
              such as a clip failure, and another test does not, such as a panel failure. 
                 It was determined that the strength factor, 0.67, when applied to the corner and edge 
              zones of steeper slope roofs (greater than 27-degree slope) could yield a nominal wind load 
              less than that in the field of the roof, based on ASCE 7 (2010). So, the limiting value of the 
              wind load in the field of the roof was introduced in the 2012 Specification. 
                 An AISI interpretation was issued in 2012 that clarified the strength factor, 0.67, that 
              was based on research that compared the static and dynamic capacities of these types of 
              roof systems, is justified to be used with the loads or load combinations in the International 
              Building Code (IBC), since this strength factor is based on structural behavior caused by 
              rate or duration of load. Therefore, this 0.67 factor is not duplicative of the consideration 
              given for multiple variable loads in both the strength design load combinations and the 
              allowable stress load combinations used in IBC and ASCE 7 (ASCE, 2010). It would be 
              appropriate to utilize the 0.67 factor on the nominal wind load for any load combination that 
              includes wind uplift as long as all of the conditions stated in Specification Section I6.3.1a 
              (Appendix A) are met.

                 It is recognized that there are other analytical tools available, especially advanced finite 
              element analyses, that have made strides in replicating the behavior of standing seam roof 
              systems and determining their dynamic uplift capacity. Therefore, alternative means of 
              analysis may be available to compare the dynamic and static behavior that could be used 
              to extend the applicability of this method, provided it was sufficiently calibrated to the 
              existing test data. Any alternative method should also comply with the rational engineering 
              analysis requirements of Section A1.2, including the appropriate safety factor and resistance 
              factor for members and connections. 
                                                                                  
            J3.4  Shear and Tension in Bolts 
               For the design of bolted connections, the allowable shear stresses for bolts have been 
            provided in the AISI Specification for cold-formed steel design since 1956. However, the 
            allowable tension stresses were not provided in Specification Section J3.4 for bolts subjected to 
            tension until 1986. In Specification Table J3.4-1, the allowable stresses specified for ASTM A307 
            (d ≥ 1/2 inch (12.7 mm)), A325, and A490 bolts were based on Section 1.5.2.1 of the AISC 
            Specification (AISC, 1978). It should be noted that the same values were also used in Table 
            J3.2 of the AISC ASD Specification (AISC, 1989). For ASTM A307, A449, and A354 bolts with 
            diameters less than 1/2 inch (12.7 mm), the allowable tension stresses were reduced by 10 
            percent, as compared with these bolts having diameters not less than 1/2 inch (12.7 mm), 
            because the average ratio of (tensile-stress area)/(gross-area) for 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) and 3/8-
            inch (9.53 mm) diameter bolts is 0.68, which is about 10 percent less than the average area 
            ratio of 0.75 for 1/2-inch (12.7 mm) and 1-inch (25.4 mm) diameter bolts. In the AISI 
            ASD/LRFD Specification (AISI, 1996), Table J3.4-1 provided nominal tensile strengths [resistance] 
            for various types of bolts with applicable safety factors. The allowable tension stresses 
            computed from F nt /Ω were approximately the same as those permitted by the AISI 1986 ASD 
            Specification. The same table also gave the resistance factor to be used for the LRFD method. In 
            2012, the table values were realigned with the AISC Specification (AISC, 2010). 
               The design provisions for bolts subjected to a combination of shear and tension were 
            added in AISI Specification Section J3.4 in 1986. Those design equations were based on Section 
            1.6.3 of the AISC Specification (AISC, 1978) for the design of bolts used for bearing-type 
            connections.  
               In 1996, tables which listed the equations for determining the reduced nominal tension 
            stress, F′nt , for bolts subjected to the combination of shear and tension were included in the 
            Specification and were retained in the 2001 edition. In 2007, those tables were replaced by 
            Specification Equations J3.4-2 and J3.4-3 to determine the reduced tension stress of bolts 
            subjected to the combined tension and shear. Specification Equations J3.4-2 and J3.4-3 were 
            adopted to be consistent with the AISC Specification (AISC, 2005).  
               In 2016, Table J3.4-1 was brought into agreement with AISC Table J3.2 (AISC, 2010) in all 
            related respects, both with regard to safety factors and F n  nominal strengths. As previously 
            stated, the nominal tensile strength values have been reduced by 10 percent for all bolts and 
            threaded fasteners less than 1/2-in. (12-mm) diameter. The nominal shear strength values have 
            also been reduced by 10 percent when threads are not excluded from the shear planes for all 
            bolts and threaded fasteners less than 1/2-in. (12-mm) diameter.

               Note that when the required stress, f, in either shear or tension, is less than or equal to 20 
            percent of the corresponding available stress, the effects of combined stress need not be 
            investigated. 
               For bolted connection design, the possibility of pull-over of the connected sheet at the bolt 
            head, nut, or washer should also be considered when bolt tension is involved, especially for 
            thin sheathing material. For non-symmetric sections, such as C- and Z-sections used as purlins 
            or girts, the problem is more severe because of the prying action resulting from rotation of the 
            member which occurs as a consequence of loading normal to the sheathing. The designer 
            should refer to applicable product code approvals, product specifications, other literature, or 
            tests.

            Cold-Formed Steel Design Manual (AISI, 2013).

            APPENDIX B, COMMENTARY ON PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO CANADA 
               This commentary on Appendix B of the Specification provides a record of reasoning behind, 
            and justification for, provisions that are applicable only to Canada. The format used herein is 
            consistent with that used in Appendix B of the Specification. 
                

                                                                                           
            C2a Lateral and Stability Bracing 

               The provisions of this section cover members loaded in the plane of the web. Conditions may 
            occur that cause a lateral component of the load to be transferred through the bracing member to 
            supporting structural members. In such a case, these lateral forces shall be additive to the 
            requirements of this section. The provisions in the Specification recognize the distinctly different 
            behavior of the members to be braced, as defined in Sections C2.1 and C2.2 of this Appendix. 
            The term “discrete braces” is used to identify those braces that are only connected to the 
            member to be braced for this express purpose. 
                                                                                           
              C2.1a Symmetrical Beams and Columns 

                C2.1.1 Discrete Bracing for Beams 

                   This section was revised to retain the two percent requirement for the compressive 
                force in the compressive flange of a flexural member at the braced location only. The 
                discrete bracing provisions for columns are provided in Specification Section C2.3. 
             
              C2.2a  C-Section and Z-Section Beams 

                 This section covers bracing requirements of channel and Z-sections and any other section 
              in which the applied load in the plane of the web induces twist. 
             
                C2.2.2 Discrete Bracing 

                   This section provides for brace intervals to prevent the member from rotating about the 
                shear centre for channels or from rotating about the point of symmetry for Z-sections. The 
                spacing must be such that any stresses due to the rotation tendency are small enough so 
                that they will not significantly reduce the load-carrying capacity of the member. The 
                rotation must also be small enough (in the order of 2°) to be not objectionable as a service 
                requirement. 
                   Based on tests and the study by Winter, et al. (1949b), it was found that these 
                requirements are satisfied for any type of load if braces are provided at intervals of 
                one-quarter of the span, with the exception of concentrated loads requiring braces near the 
                point of application. 
                   Fewer brace points may be used if it can be shown to be acceptable by rational analysis 
                or testing in accordance with Section K2 of the Specification, recognizing the variety of 
                conditions, including the case where loads are applied out of the plane of the web. 
                   For sections used as purlins with a standing seam roof, the number of braces per bay is 
                often determined by rational analysis and/or testing. The requirement for a minimum 
                number of braces per bay is to recognize that predictability of the lateral support and

                rotational restraint is limited on account of the many variables such as fasteners, 
                insulation, friction coefficients, and distortion of roof panels under load. 
             
                C2.2.3 One Flange Braced by Deck, Slab, or Sheathing 
                   Forces generated by the tendency for lateral movement and/or twist of the beams, 
                whether cumulative or not, must be transferred to a sufficiently stiff part of the framing 
                system. There are several ways in which this transfer may be accomplished: 
                (a) By the deck, slab, or sheathing providing a rigid diaphragm capable of transferring the 
                   forces to the supporting structure; 
                (b) By arranging equally loaded pairs of members facing each other; 
                (c) By direct axial force in the covering material that can be transferred to the supporting 
                   structure or balanced by opposing forces; 
                (d) By a system of sag members such as rods, angles, or channels that transfer the forces to 
                   the supporting structure; or 
                (e) By any other method that designers may select to transfer forces to the supporting 
                   structure. 
                   For all types of single web beams, the flange that is not attached to the deck or sheathing 
                material may be subject to compressive stresses under certain loading arrangements, such 
                as beams continuous over supports or under wind load. The elastic lateral support to this 
                flange provided through the web may allow an increase in limit stress over that calculated 
                by assuming that the compressive flange is a column, with pinned ends at points of lateral 
                bracing. Research indicates that the compressive limit stress is also sensitive to the 
                rotational flexibility of the joint between the beam and the deck or sheathing material. 
                   This section is intended to apply even when the flange that is not attached to the 
                sheathing material is in tension.
